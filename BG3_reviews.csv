You know your doing something right when other developers like EA/Ubisoft/Blizzard, etc, come out saying, ""Baldur's Gate 3 should not be the new standard"". 
To put it simply, they are just mad because Larian Studios will not have a battle-pass, micro-transactions and expensive DLC's.
Which after all, is all us gamer's want. Just a polished game with unlimited hours of fun. Well done Larian Studios! You can tell you actually care about games, and have bought back what it felt like 15 years ago for me.

EDIT:
reading through the comments and you can see the majority rules. when i speak of DLC's i'm referring to things that should already of been included in the base game for example, Total War Warhammer (great game btw) should, in my opinion, already include the chaos race in the base game. i shouldn't have to pay an extra $30 for this particular race, (once again just my opinion). now id happily pay for an ""expensive"" DLC/add-on whatever you want to call it for BG3, especially if its the same quality as Blood and Wine.

And I just don't have 200 hours to sink into an 80 GB RPG at my age.  I enjoyed Divinity: Original Sin and couch co-op'd with my wife in D:OS 2, but we have a mortgage and a dog and no time.

Then I read the Tweet.  You know the one: the prominent game developer who said that we cannot allow Larian to define our expectations of RPGs.  Oh, really?  I immediately bought the game and spent hours downloading it out of pure, unadulterated spite.

I am 3 hours in.  Three.  I am blown away.  I spent the first hour creating my character.  I pulled out my Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition Player's Handbook and marveled at what BG3 had enabled me to do - this is the full blown 5E character creation.  The maniacs at Larian  took Divinity: Original Sin and made it into D&D 5E, full stop.  Amazing.

And then I played for a couple of hours.

I haven't fallen in love with a game like this since Dragon Age: Origins and there is so much more depth to BG3 in the short time I've played.  Case in point: I found a lockpick, broke into a crypt, looted a burial site and was promptly incinerated by a flame trap over a greased floor.  Thank you, Larian, for reminding me of the F5 key.

The graphics are amazing.  The voice work is the best.  The cut scenes are riveting and that's usually when I go make another whisky!  The sound design is unbelievable.  Why am I noticing sound design?  I don't care about sound design!

I've misclicked so many times.  There's so much to click!  I've died in so many ways.  There are so many ways to die!  There are so many bugs, but I don't even care because in a game as complex and deep as this, you're going to experience lots and lots of FUN. 

Larian, you've done it.  You've made a game so incredible that other developers are banding together to warn us not to play your magnum opus or we won't enjoy the next Stranger Things Click Quest game or whatever garbage they're shoveling out.  

I cannot wait to spend days in Baldur's Gate 3.


* Edit 8/1/2023 after ~60 hours *

Since this review got some attention, let me give you an update after about 60 hours of Early Access.  My initial review is, obviously, hyperbolic, but that was my real-time reaction to finding a truly great game in a genre and style that I thought had been abandoned by game producers who are more interested in games as service, micro-transactions and shooters.

The best review of BG3 I could give is that this is the game I've been hoping for since Dragon Age: Origins.  I play games for systems, not so much story, and I really like both the systems and the story of this game.  If I really like a game, I look forward to starting over and trying something new (I play XCOM 2 and Dwarf Fortress a little bit.)  This game also scratches that itch, which seems strange to say about a story-driven RPG, but it really is a game that encourages you to experiment.

As it stands, on the verge of release, this game is a 10/10 for me and in my pantheon of favorites.

Here are some of the things I love about Baldur's Gate 3:

The story is engaging and full of twists and turns.The characters are well-developed and relatable.The combat is challenging and rewarding.The world is vast and full of secrets to discover.

If you're a fan of role-playing games, then Baldur's Gate 3 is a must-play. It's an epic adventure that will keep you hooked for hours on end.

One of the best CRPGs of all time, perhaps the best mainstream CRPG ever made. My playtime is real (minus the 12 hours I spent in EA), so you can see the game is HUGE. And all that playtime is filled to the brim with well-executed content.

So if you like RPGs, tactics, huge adventures, and bears, the game is a must-buy. It's not a question. The only real question is: is [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i] a 97/100?

Short answer: Act 1 absolutely is. And Act 1 took me 56 hours. If the game [b]only[/b] consisted of Act 1 with some sort of ending, it would already have been brilliant. Think about it: less than one third of [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i] is already a better game than most other CRPGs on the market. How is it even possible?

Later, however, it starts to crumble under its own weight — and I don't just mean the bugs. Those will be fixed; the meaninglessness of many final choices and lack of companion interaction likely won't. 

And it's a damn shame.

[b]GAMEPLAY[/b]
Larian RPGs aren't simply RPGs, they border isometric immersive sims, and it's a great concept, brilliantly executed here. You have your ordinary RPG fare: classes, abilities, XP, lockpicking, traps. And then you have a simulated world that you can interact with in creative and sensible ways. Can't pick a chest? Just take it away to open in camp. A boss is too tough? Surround him with explosive barrels pre-encounter and blow to smithereens. Or befriend him — you can side and kill any faction in the game. Can't reach someplace? Aside from various teleportation spells, you can also just carry a bunch of boxes to build a tower wherever you need.

Traversal is a separate — and unique — feature of the game. Most CRPGs are flat, apart from terrain in some battlefields, sometimes. Larian uses the Z axis to its full extent. [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i] has interesting jumping puzzles (what right does a CRPG even have to have those?). Some of its areas, like the Monastery, feel like legacy dungeons from a FromSoft game, and I mean it in the best way possible. They're [b]fun[/b] to explore and find routes through, secrets in. It's a game as much about exploration as it is about story and combat.

(Not to mention that it uses verticality for spectacular visual impressions in some areas.)

Another critical aspect of [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i]'s exploration is just how dense it is. Even the emptier areas are [i]packed[/i] with content. You find characters, secrets, reactivity, small stories. Figuring out a secret sometimes requires unique interactions, like reading a scroll in a certain location or casting a specific spell. It's brilliant, and fun, and the best aspect of the game by far. 

No other product on the market offers anything remotely comparable.

[b]STORY[/b]
It's hit and miss.

I'd put it this way: in this game, Acting > Characters > Story. [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i] is incredibly well-acted, I can't remember a single character, even minor, that would be presented as anything less than good, and most main characters are just charisma personified — to the point where I was disappointed I couldn't have more interactions with someone like Ketheric. So whenever a character arc struggles a bit (being too cliche or too melodramatic), the acting makes up for it. And since most characters are interesting enough, their personal stories make up for the less brilliant part of the overall narrative. So in the end, it works. 

Writing has never been Larian's strongest suit. Since you can befriend or kill any character in the game, their writing in Divinity tended to be skin-deep — and it's definitely MUCH better here. So that's progress.

The tone of [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i] would probably not be for everyone. It rarely takes itself too seriously — and it's at its best when it doesn't. The small comedic storylets (like with the smart orge) and characters (like Minsc) just ooze charm. The erotic scenes are honesly very cool — if, again, you don't take yourself too seriously. With many of them, you're not meant to.

It's also very black-and-white, almost outdated in this regard. You can absolutely have an evil playthrough, but do understand that ""evil"" means ""cackling sadistic evil that enjoys splattering squirrels and forcing people to kill themselves with their own daggers in front of you."" Good and evil are objective qualities here — and there is no grey area, no attempt at deconstruction. It's all fun if you go with it; just keep it in mind.

The game's pacing is also great. You need to rest from time to time, usually after harder fights. And most long rests launch cutscenes that explore one story or another: of your party members, weird urges, or mysterious Guardian. Companions also have a LOT of reactivity and interjections in random events. It's all mixed up to create a very natufal flow. I don't think a lot of players even notice it — rare occasions of unique reactivily (like characters having reactions to having been killed and resurrected by you) are flashier. But don't underrate the importance of overall pacing. Pacing can make or break a game.

[b]SO WHAT IS WRONG HERE?[/b]
Act 1 is absolutely brilliant and one of the best games I've ever played.

Act 2 makes some odd choices, but at least they're clearly artistic. After a dense location filled to the brim with content and reactivity, you find yourself in a huge open area with trash mob ambushes. I appreciate the Bloodborne-esque aesthetics as much as the next gal, but why does the game willingly forefit its best assets: the interesting secret-packed exploration, the reactivity, the interlocking events, the verticality?

Hint for future players: defy your natural instincts and follow the main story in Act 2 instead of exploring everything before getting to it. It'll send you off to explore anyway, but in a more fun way.

Act 3 is... huge. It's probably bigger than Acts 1 and 2 combined — which makes sense, you expect the city to be lively. And the stories are still all right in theory, but — well, half of them just don't deliver. 

The game fails to fulfill its ambitions.

You can side with [spoiler]Gortash[/spoiler] and his sensible evil proposal — except all you get is the inability to finish some companion quests and discover perhaps the biggest twist in the story, you can't get a ""normal evil ruler"" ending. That deal with the devil you made? A short cutscene in the end and nothing more. [spoiler]A non-illithid can't control the Netherbrain[/spoiler], except if you make a treacherous choice in the final cutscene, where you suddenly totally can. It feels good to gather allies for the final battle, but each of them only utters a single phrase — less than random characters in the street!

Generally speaking, siding with evil never feels like an equal choice past Act 1. It feels like a way to skip a boss fight. You're never rewarded by content for it.

You can't even discuss the final events with my whole party — only the three characters you took with you! How does that make any sense! Not to mention that companions have little to say over the course of the whole act, and there are zero to none unique interactions between them (like the conflict between Lae'zel and Shadowheart in Act 1) — and this is in the part of the story where I want their insights the most, to see how they've changed.

Don't get me wrong, the final conflict is still... all right. It offers no surprises and has too many moving parts, and your mysterious Guardian plays a role too technical and not compelling enough. And you're very much railroaded into the good ending. But it's still interesting and epic compared to other games.

It's just that my expectations were set much higher. Because Act 1 was so brilliant.

[b]CONCLUSION[/b]
Still one of the best CRPGs ever. Buy it. Play it.

Just temper the expectations Act 1 sets. The game won't hold to the same insane standard of quality, and honestly, it's okay. Even 50 hours of that quality is a treasure. I loved it.",1692806560,1692806560,True,2331,32,0.952824890613555908,51,True,False,False,True,

Things you experience in the first act come back around way later (in my case over 100 hours later) and your choices MATTER.

I didn't know until later that the NES had helped to revive the gaming industry after a crash.

My favorite way to play video games became computer gaming in the late 1990s, with the release of games like Baldur's Gate, Ultima Online, Diablo 2, and Counter-Strike. These games were all so different from each other, but they all offered something special. Baldur's Gate had an incredible story and game-changing actions. Ultima Online was a massively multiplayer sandbox that gave gamers the freedom to do whatever they wanted. Diablo 2 had an excellent atmosphere and fast-paced ARPG action. And Counter-Strike had fast-paced action and perfected shooting mechanics as an online shooter.

Over the years, I've played many other great games that have pushed the gaming industry forward. These include System Shock, Deus Ex, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Breath of the Wild, Final Fantasy VIII and IX, the Half-Life series, Portal, Left 4 Dead, Elden Ring, Bioshock, and The Last of Us. All games crafted perfectly and created with so much love and talent.

However, I've noticed that I've enjoyed fewer and fewer new games over time. I used to think that this was just a sign of getting older, but I realized that the problem was with the gaming industry itself. Most AAA titles now offer the same tired systems and graphics. The focus on realism has made games feel systematic & slightly lifeless as well as almost all games having some type of monetization system that just automatically makes the experience feel cheap and unmotivating. What happened to using your abilities and time to get the items that you want?

By 2023, I was basically only playing older games. They still offered a unique experience that I couldn't find in modern games. They didn't have monetized systems or focus on the realism that became so lifeless and cold. They were just well-crafted games that were made with a lot of labor and love by developers that wanted to make a great title just because they loved this industry just as much as I did.

Then I played Baldur's Gate 3. It was everything I had been looking for in a modern game. It was polished, true to the original Baldur's Gate, and free of monetization. It was a return to the old days when games were crafted to be amazing and had an experience that—once you purchase the title, once—were all available for you to explore just depending how you wanted to play the game. There are over hundreds of hours of cutscenes and it would most likely take thousands of hours and multiple play throughs to find everything this game has to offer. Each and every character feels like a completely unique being in the game, with their own voice-acted lines that they say, creating this world that feels so alive. Basically your play through will be unique to you and your character.  The combat—while turn based—still feels fast and exciting and open up's possibilities for you to brainstorm new ways to eliminate your foe. Your environment plays a big part on how you solve a battle. Hope you're not standing in water while fighting a mage with a lightning spell. And unlike a lot of modern RPG's, your actions absolutely have an effect on this world and the people that live in it. Even wearing specific items can affect those around you based on their beliefs or their relationship to you. And it's all done so well that it feels like a living and breathing world.

Baldur's Gate 3 did something different in the face of an industry that at times feels stagnant and same-y. Larian made a courageous game for gamers, as gamers. Baldur's Gate 3 is truly the pinnacle of gaming and I only hope  AAA studio's find this as a reminder of what games can truly be.

As of 2023, I realized that I wasn't growing out of touch with the gaming industry. The gaming industry was growing out of touch with itself. Baldur's Gate 3 is a beacon of light in a foggy and ambiguous time in gaming. The quality and care put into BG3 is what I thought most games would have strived to be in the year 2023.

If you're feeling like I do and you're tired of the gaming industry's monetization pitfalls and careless development, I highly recommend picking up Baldur's Gate 3. It's the type of game that made me fall in love with this industry all those years ago.

We've been married for over 40 years, and with our children grown up and out of the house, we found ourselves drifting apart, each lost in our own routines.

It all changed when our grandson introduced us to ""Baldur's Gate."" Initially, I was skeptical. The idea of two elderly delving into a fantasy world of wizards and warriors seemed absurd. But my husband, always the adventurer at heart, was intrigued. Together, we decided to give it a try, thinking it would be a humorous story to share with our friends.

The first time we played, it was a comedy of errors. I couldn't tell an elf from an orc, and my husband's wizard spent more time accidentally casting spells on himself than on the enemies. But as we fumbled through the game, something wonderful happened. We started laughing together like we hadn't in years. Each gaming session became a new adventure, filled with both in-game challenges and fits of laughter from our clumsy mistakes.

As we journeyed through the rich story and complex puzzles of ""Baldur's Gate,"" we began to work as a team, just like in the early days of our marriage. We strategized together, celebrated our victories, and consoled each other in our defeats. The game became our nightly ritual, a time where we could escape to a fantastical world and reconnect.

Playing ""Baldur's Gate"" rekindled something in our relationship that we thought we had lost. We found new topics to talk about, reminiscing about our in-game adventures during the day. Our shared interest in the game led to other shared activities, reigniting the spark that brought us together all those years ago.

""Baldur's Gate"" became more than just a game for us; it was a gateway to rediscovering each other. It showed us that no matter how long you've been together, there are always new and exciting ways to connect and grow as a couple. Our evenings in front of the computer, exploring the Sword Coast, became cherished moments, a testament to the enduring power of love and laughter.",1704739354,1704739354,True,2801,130,0.929559946060180664,0,True,False,False,True,

That's the game's magic, and that's also why I'm not even going to attempt to do a long, detailed review of the game. I'm not someone who necessarily vibes with the combat in [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i]- I prefer things to be faster pace, and a bit more forgiving to the occasional incorrect input. However, that's not stopping me from being extremely positive on [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i]. The main reason why I love it so much, and probably the best thing I can say about it, is that it respects your time and decisions more than any game I've ever played. Companies like Telltale blew up by creating games that give you the illusion of choice; you pick between option 1 and option 2, but the ultimate outcome is essentially the same regardless of your choice. [i]Baldur's Gate[/i] doesn't do crap like that. You will make decisions 2 hours into this game, that will impact quests and stories 50 hours into the game. Your decisions will impact who lives, who dies, who you're allied with, etc. This expands out on such a scale that there isn't 1 or 2 different outcomes, there are hundreds, probably thousands of different outcomes to thousands of different scenarios. If you and 24 of your friends all play this campaign, you'll all have wildly different experiences across the entire game; that's not something you can say about other games that have sold themselves on ""player choice/agency"". This same respect translates to exploring the world; you're rewarded with unique weapons, spells, character interactions, etc. The respect Larian has for your choices and exploration, combined with the brilliant characters and voice acing make [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i] an unforgettable experience that is extremely replayable.

BG3 is the perfect example that you can produce a quality game with no micro-transactions, no battle passes. I am not, nor have I ever been, a fan of turn-based combat. But, BG3 makes it quite fun with heavy emphasis on their story. The replay value is phenomenal. I tend to want my game play to go a specific way, which means I have restarted my adventure quite a few times, but don't feel fatigued in doing so. The fact that there are countless possibilities, the fact that every choice you make affects the game as a whole, is something so refreshing in an RPG. Too many games are far too linear. 

All in all, 10/10. Definitely GotY material. BG3 has set my standards extremely high when it comes to the quality of games I expect in the future & what I am willing to pay $60 for. 

Also, Team Gale for life, just saying.

You don't know how you got here, but you're here. And you start walking around the dump and looking around. On the right you see Blizzard - with a bunch of microtransactions, mobile games and promises not kept. On the left you see Bethesda, asking you to buy Skyrim once again, because they can't do anything good anymore, only to sell what everyone is already sick of. Oh yeah, don't forget EA. So you see all this shit around you and suddenly you stumble upon a mountain. At the top of that mountain, you see a light, it's calling you. You roll the critical success dice and you start climbing, a year, two, three, you climb amongst all this garbage that the game industry has become, where one game a year is really good, amongst a bunch of other crap, full of mediocre games called TRIPLE A PROJECTS.  And then after 6 years, you get to the top of that mountain and you see it.... Baldur's Gate 3. 

That's how I see the gaming industry all these years later. Greedy to the point of insanity, they sell crappy games with lots of microtransactions just to get more money from us, the players. Huge companies with millions of dollars can't make good games, where you can feel like a player again, not a cash cow, with which you need to buy thousands and thousands of in-game things in addition to the game. 

I think Baldur's Gate 3 is not just a game, but a wake-up call for us gamers to realize where are the good companies that make games for us and where are the toxic triple A projects that are just trying to take our money from us as soon as possible while feeding us some mediocre games ""Like Assassin's Creed series from Ubisoft, that became complete garbage by the end."" 

I can go on and on, but why write something, that most of us already know? It's time to stop feeding all this shit companies and support real ones, like Larian Studios, that year after year provide us only masterpieces, like Divinity before and Baldur's Gates now. They do it for us, guys, let's not fail them and give this game as much praise as possible. Maybe this will wake up most of the companies and they can see what a real game should look like. 

P.S. Don't get me wrong. I know there is many good games as well, companies that try too, indie companies (are my favourite ones, because they do the game from heart and soul), but let's be honest. Most of the games we see lately is pure garbage just to make money from us. Time to wake up guys. 

Regarding Baldur's Gate 3, I will say this. The moment game came out, I can't quit it. Me and my friend are playing this game maybe for 4 days already, non stop. I can't remember when I had the same addiction to the game before. Worth to play, worth to buy. Thank you Larian Studios for another masterpiece, love you guys.

But what I was (and still am!) is an avid TTRPG player, and a D&D player. All 900+ hours of Critical Role? Yup. Dimension20? Also yes. I love the collaborative nature of games, of exploring what is possible, and the telling of a good story. I had hear a little about this Baldur's Gate game coming out from friends who played EA, seen some clips online, and then on release, I saw it everywhere. There's a big cross-over between BG3 fans and D&D fans, surprising no one. I didn't have a gaming console that could play it (see above: the Switch), nor a laptop good enough (my laptop could barely handle three open windows at a time), and I assumed this would be a game I couldn't play for a while. I was curious about it, as I heard it replicated D&D mechanics well and that combat was turn-based. One of the things that I have been intimidated by other games (I've tried Skyrim and BOTW, and let me tell you I'm not great at real-time combat) seemed like it would not be a problem here. My curiosity was well and truly caught.

Then comes me stumbling across a Reddit post about if you could play it, and finding the GeForce Now service. I figured I would sign up to a lower tier, get the game, see if my laptop and internet could handle it, and go from there.

Well. That was back in September 2023. It is now February 2024. I have over 400 hours, two completed campaigns, and well on the way to finishing a third, and I now own a gaming pc capable of playing it without GeForce Now. To say it change my life and opened up a whole host of experience, really doesn't do it justice.

BG3 is not only incredibly gorgeous in the graphics, it is full of heart and story in a way that took me by surprise. The countless solutions that are available to the presented problems blows me away (seriously, I would love to peak behind the covers of what those planning meetings were like!), how creativity is constantly rewarded by unique and fun dialogues. I'm still finding 'new' things on every play through, still talking to friends old and new about different ways we've approached problems, and I still am so engaged. Not only that, the writing and acting of every companion, tav, and npc in this game is incredible. I've learned about their stories, felt their successes, cried with the ending of character arcs as if they were my own. I have been faced with choices that made me reconsider everything I knew about the game, made me examine my own reactions when playing through the lens of another character.

Yes, it has turn-based combat and that is absolutely a feature and a highlight of the experience. There is an incredible amount of choices across class, background, and race that lets you craft a character to your liking, and then rewards you for playing into that character. There's loot, and meta jokes, and moments that show you a team of incredibly dedicated humans put so much care and love into crafting the best came they could. The feeling of capturing a real D&D game and putting on the screen is hard, and I think the team did a fantastic job at realising that experience.

This game also got me through some incredibly tough moments at the end of 2023. It's escapism and joy and I cannot thank the stars that aligned to bring it across my path. The community that has grown around it in online spaces is a delight and brought connection at times when I needed it.

You probably already know everything I’m going to say, so why wait?

So, yeah, what we have here is a game that is likely to win multiple “Game of the Year” awards, will be remembered in 2029 as one of the best games of the decade, and will be found on many peoples’ lists of the greatest games of all time. It is an absolute triumph in nearly every possible way, and we should all be grateful that it exists. That may sound hyperbolic, but I mean every word: this game could shake up the gaming landscape as we know it in ways that only benefit us as players. In a world of battle passes, loot boxes, and DLC, here comes [i]Baldur’s Gate 3[/i] with its dick swinging: a [b]huge[/b], complete game whose developers have no plans for DLC, whatsoever. Even EActivisionSoft will sit up and take notice when this game continues to exist in the public consciousness for a long time to come.

“[b]But slanderoid[/b],” I hear you shrieking into your monitor or phone or PDA or whatever, “[b]we get that you think the game is important, but is it [i]fun?![/i][/b]”

Let me answer your question with another question: What other game would have the player walk in on a goblin porking an orc in a barn and then have to kill them to keep them from ripping your team apart in a blue-balled rage? How about having the player talk a mad scientist into performing surgery on himself to avoid fighting him in a boss battle? How about letting a helpful but overly zealous bard pull out your character’s eyeball in an attempt to remove the Yeerk from their head, only to replace it with an eyeball he had in his pocket? Sounds like fun, no? …No? Oh, maybe I could have phrased it better: Yes. This game is fun as hell.

You’ll find all of that in this game. Or you won’t. Maybe you’ll find all different stuff. The number of different paths and events in this [b]huge[/b] game is genuinely staggering. Normally this is the kind of thing that would give me choice paralysis, forcing me to turn the game off and never come back again. [i]However[/i], since every choice leads to something interesting, surprising, or, yes, fun, I never really felt like I was missing out. Honestly, I just feel like I need to play it again some time and choose completely different options next time.

Okay, let’s run down the list of other great stuff in this game: this game is gorgeous, even on my ancient GTX 1080; the characters are believably expressive, adding to the immersion; the music is memorable; the voice acting is excellent; and narratively, this game is immediately gripping and never lets go. Basically, anyone who has a litmus test for what makes a good game, this game passes. It’s almost guaranteed.

The story would be nothing, of course, if it wasn’t full of amazingly badass characters. Every member of the player’s party comes with an interesting back story and a set of side quests that will determine their fate as the story unfolds. Seriously, even the suckiest character (Wyll) has a cool story. And, as you’re probably aware, you can romance any of the people on your team and you’ll learn even more about them. I haven’t even mentioned the hordes of NPCs that the player encounters throughout the realm that have full stories of their own.

Now, this wouldn’t be one of my reviews without sharing one of my objectively awful opinions that’s likely to leave you completely dumbfounded about how I manage to even play games at all. (Other than saying that Wyll sucks, that is.) So, here it is: I wish there was a setting to bypass all of the dice rolls during conversations. Not just the animation – the whole ass mechanic itself. As someone who doesn’t give two farts about D&D, the dice rolls just feel like a way for the game to keep my character from doing what I want them to do. I’ve been playing this for well over 100 hours (and I’ve only just started Act III, so I’m counting on another few dozen hours, at least) and I’m getting old enough that I’ve begun staring into the face of my own mortality, so I just want the decisions I make in the game to be followed through with – not checked against RNG to see if my decision would work out. In a world where Nabbit and Funky Kong exist, I don't think it's too much to ask... As it is, I’ve spent a great deal of time sitting in front of the loading screen after reloading my last save because a die roll didn’t go the way I wanted it to.

I’ll give you a moment to get your heartrate back to normal. Take ten deep breaths. Do you still feel like smashing your keyboard or phone or stylus or whatever? Okay, take another second. 

Did you get it out of your system? Okay, let’s get back to it.

I know that I was talking up the different, random paths the player can find themselves taking through the story just a little bit ago, but I think the die rolls would be better on my second playthrough. I’d love to see what kind of crazy crap happens when I fail a die roll for telling a bog hag to eat shit. But, on my first time through, I don’t want the outcome to be out of my hands. I just want to tell her to eat crap and let nature take its course without RNG getting in the way.

Okay, I’m done disparaging the fundamental mechanics of TTRPGs. However, I’d be an even crappier reviewer if I didn’t remind readers that this game is [b]huge[/b] with hundreds of different possible outcomes in any given moment of the game – so there are bugs. I’ve had the game crash several times, which was frustrating until I remembered to save early and save often.

Which brings me to one of my favorite features of this game that I haven’t heard much about. When I first started playing, I tried relying on the autosave to carry me through the game. This was a mistake – it only reliably autosaves when you enter a new map and the maps in this game are (care to take a guess?) [b]huge[/b]. Instead, the game allows the player to make manual saves [i]at any time[/i]. Have you been battling for way longer than you expected and now your mom is calling you downstairs for dinner? You can save if you need to. Are you in the middle of a conversation with an NPC but your cat has become a puke cyclone, so now you’ve got to step away and get mopping? Save. Are you in the middle of a date with your in-game romantic interest where you can see their nips and you want to come back to it again later – for science? Save, save, save!

I know it’s a silly thing to love about a game that is revolutionary in many ways but I’m a simple man. I’d love to see this feature show up in more games in the future. Autosave has come a long, long way but sometimes I’d love to be able to make manual saves whenever I want, too. I want it all!

Anyway, that’s enough rambling, I think. This game is fantastic. It’s my game of the year for good reason. (It even beat out [i]Resident Evil 4[/i], an outstanding remake of my favorite game of all time.) Barring financial or health reasons, everyone should play it. That means [b]you[/b]. [b]You[/b] should play this game. If you’re somehow still on the fence about playing it despite there being over 400,000 positive reviews of the game at the time of writing and, for some reason, this review is the one that is going to tip the scales: [i]play it, for god’s sake![/i] It’s worth every penny you’ll spend on it and many, many more.",1701176868,1702453931,True,786,71,0.912207901477813721,0,True,False,False,True,

We started the game excited about what was to come and it took us a total of two months to the clock to finish it. In our case, we decided to go with two custom characters and build relationships with the various origins characters in the game. We created our characters and thrust ourselves into the new campaign, both completely new to the world of Baldur's Gate, but not new to the work of Larian. 

The game's writing is amazing, with every choice having the weight you'd expect if not more. The approach to the narrative, storytelling, and story progression is in your hands completely. From smaller things like specific races and backgrounds having extra options during certain dialogues giving more depth to your story, to annihilating an entire faction. Easily one of the best implementations of DnD to a game.

8h into the game, while exploring, we unlocked a way to reset the levels of our characters. Considering this was a title developed after Divinity 2, I went into it expecting there would be the possibility to change your character's appearance, but that wasn't the case. When the option wasn't available alongside the respec, especially as it has less actual impact on the game, I decided a quick search was mandatory as both me and my friend wanted to change a few things about our characters we were not happy with.
Although a way to change your looks has now been patched into the game, that was not the case more than two months ago and in an attempt at enjoying the many more hours we'd have on the title, we restarted from scratch, recreated our characters and quickly got back to where we were. 

After that, it was smooth sailing. We kept exploring every crook and cranny and would never leave a region before making sure all loose ends were close and we had explored everything. The quantity and quality of content the game offers it's magical and calls for multiple playthroughs just to see how much love and attention has been put into it. We took our time - clearly - and made sure to play as meticulously as we would alone not letting the coop get in the way of attention to lore, books or dialogues. We had a wonderful time, really. Great game to play with the right person!

All dialogues have so much depth and have been motion acted! There is a moment in the late game, where one of the dialogues has such amazing voice acting and animation that it has forever engraved itself in my mind. That's how good it was. Another moment that comes to mind is a discovery we made during a mission. Something very unexpected, yet it was the truth and completely changed our objectives going forward, at least for our roleplay whereas for others it might have motivated them even further. This is the beauty of this game, everything you do and every approach is just as valid as the next one. This was not unique in these 160 magical hours. Throughout all of them, me and my friend kept being shocked by the level of detail, interaction, and ramifications of the story. There are so many other examples I could give. 

But where there is good, there is bad. During the final Act we did encountered a few bumps. Still god-tier, but it is worth mentioning. Progression in particular felt sluggish, as if at every corner we would meet a wall that would make all our choices and plans crumble somewhere else as a consequence. It took us many hours, with a lot of different approaches to our progress to find the perfect balance for what to do first.

Regardless of our best attempts and careful approach, during our finale, we could not forsee this turn of events. We had to make a really hard choice to get the best outcome and find common ground with my friend, so I was already saddened by that. Right after that, my favorite origin character, my romance and companion through most of the run took a steep turn I didn't expect in their story. I was so confused by this end result considering the path we had both walked on was not the one they were now choosing, even slightly hinting at it being also my idea when it never was. I later learned shortly after seeing the finale that what I thought was an inconsequential choice made during a dialogue -  one I would even say was quite neutral - was the dialogue that would permanently determine their story. This was prior to even learning and talking about the potential alternative new objective for this origin character. There is no other dialogue or check of any sort that can change that and, in my experience, nothing in the game made me understand things would have gone this way after I made this choice. Hell, it even sounded like it was still up for debate. 70h after I learned my price. 

For the whole game, I have been preaching this, so: I know it's technically the result of my own choices, and since then I accepted the end result and found many ways to level with it when it comes to roleplay. That said, I stand my ground that having the choice to determine which path the character will follow, prior to knowing what are the options, and with a neutral response isn't well done, not when for everyone else it was quite clear. A simple dialogue after the events would have done it.
 
Add to insult injury, although I was the host, my friend during the whole finale was the only character visible besides the origins, only because he had the character that could defeat the final boss in his group. That was the case even for dialogues with my romance and companion. The coop never had any such issues until now, often having our characters at least in the background during dialogues.

The game is a solid top-down CRPG, and controls very similarly to Divinity 2. I wished for some of the prior games' limitations not to show up again. After all these years of early access and a new camera zoom that can go close to third-person perspective, I was disappointed in not having the choice to bind movement to WASD when that is the default for controller players. Especially in a game that, with all the dev's good intentions, still struggles with camera angles and environment objects at times. Yes, things become transparent when too close to the camera, but are still interactable making your character move in the wrong direction or teleport back to the area you just came from simply cause it's a big door and its hitbox is still in front of your mouse.
As a hoarder, something I also was hoping would have been improved is inventory management. There are plenty of bags in the game to order your items around, although you can't name them. When sorting, identical items will not merge into one stack, making entire lines of the same spell scroll unless you manually stack them, which I obviously did. A small icon next to books to let us know if we had read them would have also been a nice addition, especially with the large amount of literature available. 
Other than that, the game plays perfectly fine and it's an extremely polished experience, with almost no gameplay limitations but your imagination.

Still, you know what they say: it's not the destination, but the journey that matters. Although I had wished for a better ending to my adventure, nothing can change our journey. What really matters is how excited, happy, and impatient I was to come home and play this game, and no amount of sour endings could erase that. I made a mark in this world and shared this crazy adventure with a friend, with highlights we'll bring back for likely the rest of our lives as already do with other titles, or until the next Larian game.

Let me start being brief; Larian Studios has blown me away.

For some context of who I am and where I come from? I have loved the divinity games for a few years now and was hyped for them being announced to make the successor to Balldur's Gate I & II. 
I am a also a Gamemaster and have been for Dungeons & Dragons nearly fourteen years now. I've been in the DnD sphere of games and RPGs since the beginnings of 2nd Edition when I was really young. I have experienced each system across the board, numerous titles accompanying the array of editions published. 

To speak of BG III itself; What Larian did here not only blew away my expectations as a D&D experience, but honored many of the greatest markers of D&D and RPG (and CRPG) history that can be found as D&D has evolved over its many years. What Larian has done is created the perfect gateway into Baldur's gate and older classics with the fervor and easy accessibility of 5th edition D&D. 

Baldur's Gate III has done the impossible, this is the perfect place to begin if you never played D&D and would like to feel what its like or if you just cannot access a D&D group and still would like to play. BG III utilizes the best parts of the game system and highlights them with an exemplary immersive experience that showcases many old classics that came before in the same curated heart and care in their creation years ago.
Even still, it rests at a comfortable price with an innumerable amounts of replay-ability at your fingertips with one price tag. No micro-transactions, no subscriptions, no catches. BG III was made for you and I; both fans and gamers each. A true testaments to the games that came before and were adored for the respect and care for not only the game, but those who are playing their game. 

Larian Studios have been folk I have chosen to watch closely a while now, and I have zero hesitancy today they are one of the developers to keep even closer eyes on. They are a relic of Gaming seemingly lost and excruciating difficult to find in the western markets today, and they have my full adoration and respect.

Baldur's Gate III is in a very small and shrinking category each passing year. One of the few games released in recent years I found worth my time and money as it was a full packaged deal that truly captivate me and have me inspired with hope to finally sit down and enjoy where the sky is the limit.",1705706703,1705708633,True,249,5,0.887070834636688232,4,True,False,False,True,

[i]Takes a deep breath.[/i] Repeat after myself: I can write a short review, I can write a short review, [strike]I can writ-[/strike]

What an emotional roller coaster. What a terrific job Larian did with this game, I didn't even expect half of it and it hit me straight to the heart.
While suffering through several different breakdowns, which, don't get me wrong, means I had an incredibly good time, I thought I'd leave a [i]few[/i] words about what I liked most about Baldur's Gate 3. Woo.

With the sheer amount (understatement of the year, couldn't think of a better phrase) of options and choices the game provides you with, you find yourself multiple times lost in thoughts about following or alternative playthroughs while playing your current one. Just to see a different outcome, consequences, dialogues or simply try an other class and travel with different companions. It's one of my greatest highlights this year, no decade, a huge advantage the game has compared to other rpgs and such a rare and treasured trait.

Throughout your adventure and exploration your companions react animatedly to your choices, they (dis-)approve, snark, comment, bicker with each other and can even change their entire behavior. This can be particularly gut-wrenching during the evil/succumb to dark urge run. While I'm always trying to play a sassy asshole, I'm also always trying to help everyone. Genuinely hurting others AND admitting said action to their face, with those god damn expressive faces, was frightening and [i]still[/i] such an interesting experience I can highly recommend.

I can't count how many times I reloaded a save, not to achieve a different outcome, but to check the other dialogue options, or see another companions reaction. And. They. All. Deliver. It's SO rewarding! How many times did I end up thinking ""Wow, I didn't know I could do that!"" or laughed my ass off because of the spectacular job the VAs did with the companions, even with some trivial NPCs. It's addictive. Exhilarating. Terrific. I cannot find the right words for how much of an impressive job Larian did with giving all those characters voice lines and choosing great actors for it.

Spoiler free example why this should be the GOTY: 
After 300+ hours thinking I've seen everything and picking up every quest, it blew my mind to get a [i]completely[/i] different outcome and cutscene by simply changing the [b]ORDER[/b] of a few sidequests I thought were inconsequential. And I'm not talking about a failed check or another option I chose, no, just a different order. Still haunts me.

Baldur's Gate 3 is definitely my game of the decade and carved itself a special place into my heart. I do hope other game developers will take this as an example how it [u]should[/u] be done. YES, I'M TALKING TO YOU, BIOWARE! How am I supposed to play something else now and not compare it to BG3?

TLDR:

++ captivating storytelling, esp dark urge run and the pale elf questline
++ soundtrack, excuse me, that one fight, what the actual HELL
++ enthralling, entrancing and funny characters, the companions and npcs have very interesting personalities, Larian did a phenomenal job with their facial expressions and body language, listen, [i]I cannot mention that often enough[/i]
++ Voice Acting, seriously, give them a price, in particular Neil Newbon, they fit their characters exceptionally
++ gameplay and combat, I'm usually not a turn-based combat player, but the mechanics are fun for weird or powerful combinations, easy to understand and learn even for beginners
++ graphics, everyone and its great grandmother looks way to pretty in this game ugh
++ animal speech. Excuse me, this is nonnegotiable, you have to try it

-- no photomode, WHY? PLEASE!
-- the AI needs a few more tweaks so companions stop running into traps or refuse to jump after you
-- character creation is a bit too simplified, still sufficient, but could have offered more options, so you don't stumble into NPC twins/look-alikes
-- longer or at least deeper friendship epilogues, after fighting for and with everyone, I deserve to see them happy or spend a few moments and conversations with them about everything we've been through

Baldurs gate 3 is what modern western Devs hate. A quality title packed to the brim with unique content. Modern Devs say themselves that providing too much quality and content is apparently bad, as it sets standards that are ""hard"".  Most devs prefer to create absolute trash that's half working and packed with micro transactions. It's so refreshing to have another studio along side Fromsoft that actually cares about the consumer. 

This game is loving crafted with nothing but the player in mind, hundreds of hours await you in this detailed, deep and beautifully crafted RPG. Just like Elden ring set the new standard for open world  action RPGs, Baldur Gate 3 has just set the new standard for turn based RPGS. 
 
The choice of engine for the game perfectly fits the D&D feel as it allows you to approach encounters in creative ways that non pen-and-paper RPGs normally wouldn't allow.  Most of what makes Dungeons & Dragons fun is the freedom you have in how to navigate the situations you find yourself in, and I find the heavily updated Divinity engine is as close as you're going to get to that in a video game.  Having one character throw a nearby barrel of water at a group of enemies and then casting an ice spell on the puddle with your wizard, causing all the enemies to slip on the now frozen ground making them ""prone"" and open to more successful attacks... this is the kind of creative gameplay that usually is only found around a table with a group of friends and a Dungeon Master. 

Get this game, support the new (actually old) standards, accept nothing less and watch these Devs squirm.

---

I don't mean that in a negative way; but it can take some time adjusting if you were expecting a pure experience of one or the other. But it's effectively exactly what you might expect from a developer who has made so many entries into the Divinity series and then attempts to build a sequel to a franchise they originally had nothing to do with. (Baldur's Gate)

What's here is an attempt at recreating some of that classic 90's CRPG feel with somewhat modernized streamlining. It doesn't go the full open-world of something like The Elder Scrolls series (Skyrim, etc.), but you do have a lot of freedom in your choices of how to complete the story choices and with plenty of side quests to explore. But it is very much a hub world, warping you from one set piece to another. Combat is turn based, while exploring outside of combat can be toggled to free running or turn based.

Some people have complained that there is no ""pause"" but that's only if you don't understand you can simply toggle to turn based and remain ""paused"" on your turn for as long as you want. Toggling off turn based to run around means the simulation of the world is moving at the same time as you. So a wandering group of enemies could stumble into you at any time and the game would force you into turn mode for combat anyway.

The biggest praise I can give the game is that the story is well written, at least the 10 or so hours I've experienced of it so far. Exploring and combat are functional but not ground breaking. 

Character creation has a lot of options in some areas, but limited in others. A variety of classes, a middling selection of customization options aside from color variety and a disappointingly small number of voice options, most of which don't suit your non-human racial options. You'll probably still find something fun to play as, but it may not be exactly what you thought it would be. I expect there will be a wide range of mods to add to this some day, but that day isn't at launch.

It also ignores some of the D&D rules, which further solidifies this as a more of a hybrid with Divinity. If you don't care then  you won't even notice this. But if you're a D&D purist you'll be wondering at some of the odd changes. (I'm not going to bother listing them in detail, most people won't care and those that do will find them easy enough on their own)

I haven't had any performance issues on launch day. The game runs well enough assuming you actually meet the listed requirements. 

There's not much else to say; the game is pretty straight forward about what it wants to be: ""a story-rich, party-based RPG set in the universe of Dungeons & Dragons, where your choices shape a tale of fellowship and betrayal, survival and sacrifice, and the lure of absolute power"" (quoted from the store page) and so far it seems to mostly deliver on this promise.

I could complain about the combat being simple or the game feeling like it's a very pretty skin over a 1990's mindset but are those even complaints? They are very deliberate design choices. Most complaints I could make just feel petty when the main feature of the game is very well done.

And just to be clear that main feature is delivering a party based RPG in a story-rich world. This is definitely a game you can get lost in for hours.

As for me, I enjoyed the original Baldur's Gate games and I've had some fun with Divinity games and I'm not that picky over changing the D&D rules so I guess I'm the target market. Beyond that, what you see on the store page is what you get; it's not hiding any micro-transactions or lying about what it is.
---

Bottom line: If you're a Fantasy RPG fan you probably don't want to skip this.

I hope this encourages AAA makers to be willing to let their creatives create. I REALLY hope that Bioware is paying attention, and maybe they will allow the writers and creatives to beef up the story aspects of DA: Dreadwolf before it releases. We can dream.

This was an experience. I don't usually write reviews for games, even my favorite ones, but I write reviews for books, and this game felt like a book to me.

[h3]The Good[/h3]

First, I want to say how incredibly developed most of the story is, particularly the lifelike portrayal of the characters. The voice acting sets a new standard, arguably the best across all games, given the extensive voice work throughout. Even minor characters are voiced with excellence. The gameplay was something completely new to me, as I've never played DnD nor any game of this playstyle before. I was weirded out by the combat at the start, but as time passed and I managed to kill a formidable boss by distracting it with a cat. Needless to say, I fell in love with the combat. This game offers unparalleled freedom, allowing players to explore various paths, each with its own beauty. Also, story-wise, so many characters say some genuinely profound quotes that left me pondering for hours. LOTR is probably my favorite movie series, and fantasy books are my favorite genre to read; this game provided me with that immersion while giving me the choice to shape the story in almost any direction I wanted. Playing through the Creche during Act 1, accompanied by the music of Mountain Pass, felt like experiencing Fellowship of The Ring in game form.

The music, in particular, deserves commendation—it stands among the best I've encountered across all forms of media, not just in video games. I was flabbergasted to learn that most of the ambient tracks haven't even been officially released. Kudos to Borislav Slavov for the incredible soundtrack; I'll always remember him and what he made me feel with his music.

Acts 1 & 2 are nearly flawless. Act 1 was polished to impossible magnitudes; every side quest was lovable, every location was there for a solid reason, every enemy, every character, especially the Creche and Underdark parts. I haven't felt so excited for a game as I was during playing Act 1 since forever. Then, Act 2 surpassed it for me and became my favorite. I was drawn to its eerie, mysterious, and dark ambiance, which constantly reminded me that I didn't belong there. Amidst the darkness, stumbling upon a brightly lit inn, where goodness prevailed against all odds, the last frontier of humanity, it left a lasting, hopeful impact. Lastly, The villain of Act 2 was built up for 60 hours and delivered every single ounce of it.

[b][i]""I have a price to pay for my power; it will cost me your life…for my own, I have already paid.""[/i][/b]

[h3]The Bad[/h3]

Throughout the first half of the game, I was astonished and was sure this is the most perfect game ever made, but it really does have its issues. The issues showed in Act 3. It felt like an entirely different game, marred by performance issues and a rushed, unpolished plot. Certain plotlines, including that of the guardian, felt forced, inserted merely for the sake of a twist. The pacing felt off, and the quests lacked coherence. The world is in imminent danger of being completely destroyed, but meanwhile, you can halt all of that and go exorcise a possessed individual, searching for clues around the city. Why not, I guess?

[h3]The Ugly[/h3]

Bugs became noticeable towards the end of Act 2, and by Act 3, they rendered the game almost unplayable at times. I found myself restarting frequently during Act 3. Not only were there strange battles where waiting for turns dragged on for 5 minutes, but they were also plagued with bugs. I refrained from using many spells, including summons, due to their buggy and game-breaking nature. Even pets were affected. The ultimate disappointment came during the final fight, which I had hoped would be more polished. Instead, it was riddled with switcheroo bugs that made watching the fights impossible. It was an absolutely dreadful experience.

Another frustrating issue was the romance aspect. Like, I want to hug Gale, as a friend, or Wyll, I do not want to have sex with them. Not everyone I hug is someone I want to be intimate with, nor does showing kindness to someone necessarily indicate romantic feelings. The whole dynamic felt forced, leading me to make decisions I otherwise wouldn't have made just to avoid unintentionally initiating a romance.

[h3]Conclusion[/h3] 

This game is truly remarkable, perhaps one of the best ever created. It had the potential to be even greater, I believe, if the final act received the same level of care, attention to detail, and polish as Acts 1 and 2. Nevertheless, despite its flaws, it remains an incredible experience. It's certain to hold a place in my top 5 games of all time. I'd rate it a solid 9/10. As for its shortcomings, maybe they get tackled with a definitive edition in the future, and it will become a 10/10? Well, hopefully.

[b] Move over therapists, [/b] because Baldur's Gate 3 is my new emotional support fireball. Seriously, I've never felt so understood. This game gets me – it knows that when faced with a problem, the solution is 99% of the time a fiery explosion. Diplomacy? More like ""diplo-mighty-fireball-you-see.""

Baldur's Gate 3's combat is an unpredictable blend of tactics and comedy, where your plans might go up in smoke, but the unexpected outcomes often lead to the most memorable moments. Whether you're wielding a sword, slinging spells, or accidentally lobbing an incendiary barrel at your own feet, the combat ensures that every battle is an adventure in itself.

The dialogue options are gold. I'm pretty sure I've gone through every conversation tree just to find the sassiest retorts. ""Do you want to save the world?"" they ask. Nah, I just want to see how many times I can accidentally burn it down before the credits roll.

[b] In conclusion, [/b] Baldur's Gate 3 is a must-play for fire enthusiasts, disaster artists, and those who believe in solving problems by turning them into... well, more explosive problems. So grab your spellbook and a fire extinguisher – you're gonna need both. Burn, baby, burn!

In the meantime, I am playing via GeForce now so that I can have higher graphics quality AND do recordings.
I'm also in Act 2.
What I wrote here remains true for me (it's getting better and better if anything), but I may have to overhaul the whole review at a point.

[h3]The following certainly has influenced my experience;[/h3]
I played BG1, BG2, IWD, PS:T and NWN1 with expansions all within the last year, so the memory is relatively fresh. All I knew about D&D 5E is from Idle Champions, in the meantime, I learned a few things.
While some say it is not recommended, I am doing my first playthrough with the Dark Urge background and the intent to resist as hard as I can. With this background, you not only have some dark force inside you, but also wake up in your pod covered with blood, remembering nothing but your name. For me, this intensifies the experience.

[h3]Old player confusion...[/h3]
I was utterly confused with the spell system at first (I perfectly understand prepared spells and spell slots, but I still confused this at the beginning and then wondered why I couldn't cast anymore...). 
Same with the controls... the latter I resolved by adjusting the key bindings a bit (I automatically hit spacebar when I have to think about my next move, Q or G when something dangerious may be ahead and...)

[h3]Technical issues[/h3]
I also had technical problems, because I am playing on a low end laptop. If you consider buying, keep in mind that BG3 is resource-heavy. There are workarounds for older machines, there are useful guides, got tips from friends and made a video about how to be able to play with the graphics still looking nice and without too much lag.

[h3]Be open[/h3]
The biggest mistake you can make is comparing BG3 to any other game or expect it to be the same experience as any other game. 
It's a different game, with a different ruleset, with different combat mechanics, and comparisons only will ruin your experience. 
Best approach it with an open mind.

[h3]Graphics, effects, sounds, music, atmosphere...[/h3]
Just love the graphics, it is all so detailed, and in my opinion they did a great job with the facial expressions in cutscenes, how they change. (It may lead to your character looking totally different, but so be it.)
The music, the atmosphere... 
Spells and spell effects also are nice. Personally, I like how spells are cast by saying what they are supposed to do in Latin and a lot of gesturing.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3035458878

[h3]Variety[/h3]
There are very dark moments (for the background I chose, at least), then again some more light-hearted „normal“ adventuring, where you can explore the beautiful landscape, grab everything that isn't nailed down, go treasure-hunting and/or enter a dungeon.

[h3]An eye for details may pay off[/h3]
It may be only me, but from the beginning, I saw reminders of other games all over the place. The way how something is described, some specific phrases, even had one or the other WTF-Wrong Game?-moments. It's in the details.
There definitely ARE references to BG1 and 2. You can find books which mention characters and events from these games. There also are tiny little details you will only notice when you either played the old games or know a lot about D&D lore, including the Faerûnian pantheon and the history of the game world(s).

[h3]Dice rolls all over the place[/h3]
Maybe they overdid it with the skill checks. The RNGod rules here. Can be annoying or frustrating at times, when the dice decide a bit too much.
On the other hand, these can lead to funny situations which give a certain tabletop feel. When you fail at what you are best at, but succeed at what you are worst at. Or when the Wizard without Perception bonus detects a trap first. Made me laugh a couple times.

[h3]Philosophical?[/h3]
There also are some philosophical moments. If you explore everything carefully, interact with everything, talk to everyone and everything and read all the books, not only does it show that the designers knew their lore, it also may raise a few questions if you think about it.
You even can encounter an NPC early on who asks you a philosophical question.
Had a very emotional moment here (also because... my poor character... almost picked the second option) SPOILER WARNING:

[h3]Play the way you want to[/h3]
You can play this game for the combat part (which can be fun) or for the story or for both.
I found thorough exploration and having an eye for details most rewarding. 
As for combat, can be fun. There are so many different things you can do and try.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3035458905

[h3]Thinking outside the box[/h3]
It appears that you can confuse the AI a bit by doing something unexpected. I was able to beat a group of enenmies of at least level 3 and larger than my level 2 group without a fighter in my team. I am playing only on Balanced, but still... was fun.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3035458917

I am still very early in the game and don't know what is yet to come, I still may end up disappointed or find myself unable to win a battle or otherwise get stuck or frustrated. I certainly hope not.

As I only have seen a small fraction of the game and, as I already said, the experience is a personal one, this recommendation is to be taken with a grain of salt.",1694687684,1719571246,True,143,5,0.827697932720184326,18,True,False,False,True,

I say this without any intention of hyperbole - I truly feel this is one of the greatest CRPGs ever made. 

I've noticed that this game is attracting a lot of people who are not familiar with the term 'CRPG'. There may be a few definitions, but the one I use is that it's an RPG that you play on the computer as opposed to on a physical tabletop, such as a TTRPG. TTRPGs are games like Dungeons & Dragons (duh), Vampire The Masquerade, and Thirsty Sword Lesbians. (Don't worry about that last one, ask your mom.) CRPGs replicate that experience and make them playable in single-player with the video game acting as the Dungeon Master (DM). This puts them contrary to other RPGs like Skyrim and Dark Souls for example, which are good RPGs also, but they don't set out to replicate that tabletop roleplaying experience in quite the same feel.

That said, if you're a fan of any types of RPG, there's a good chance you might like BG3. If you're a fan of TTRPGs, you'll likely love BG3. The game uses the D&D 5th edition ruleset which is accessible for both veterans and people who are new. If you're new, I encourage you to play around a bit with different class & race combinations until you find one that feels interesting yet comfy and you get a chance to see the differences in your playthrough based on your choices. Choice is one of the most important aspects of this game.

If you're a veteran, you'll notice several small changes to the 5e ruleset to make it fit more cohesively in a video game, but it will still feel like an authentic DND experience in 3D. I think Larian has done a great job of listening to the community and taking feedback on what works and what doesn't. The result is a game that feels true to DND but lets you do cool stuff you maybe couldn't in the TTRPG version. They also tried to remove a couple of annoying bits to minimize frustration. An example is that Mage Hand no longer needs line of sight.

The story, characters, gameplay, graphics, music, and general game design is fantastic. You won't really be playing this game for the achievements, but if you do, you'll have several hundred hours of play finding every secret.

Yet this game still exceeded those expectations with its immediately gripping narrative, robust characters, and deep game mechanics. Every ounce of this game pours out with love from its creators and the amount of dialogue specific class/character prompts is truly mind boggling. It is not, however, a flawless game, if this game were released before the days of games coming out half baked I would say this would have been an above average buggy experience. By today's standards it is fine as it is a functional and fully fleshed out finished game. Understandably there is also a lot of deep game mechanics at play here and although I'm not a game designer, I can appreciate how these would lend themselves to more bugs. As the systems struggle to play nice with each other while offering you as much freedom to play how you want. After all creating DnD in video game form is no easy feat and this has by far accomplished it more than any other in my mind. I would say in every game session I had I encountered bugs but most of these are not of note and are just graphical issues. At the most I would lose an hour and a half which would be frustrating but not enough to deter me from continuing and usually it is a combat encounter being repeated. That being said I only lost that amount of time twice so most bugs are lot more minute in comparison. As you learn the game mechanics and systems you also learn how to play around most of these issues and thus the later I went into the game the less amount of time I lost to silly things. I put 200 hours into a single play through and was impressed and blown away through all of it. There is just so much to appreciate in this game, so much to revisit and things to be excited about on further play-throughs. It may not be a perfect game but in my mind it is one of the best.

Story Review:
In brief, this game is the definition of CYOA (Choose your adventure). There are really a lot of bad guy in this game, but it is up to you if you want to be the bad guy, or the good guy. or the good guy turn bad, or vice versa. I can assure you the story is when Dark plot and Fun plot have a children.
9/10

Gameplay:
TBH! I don't play this kind of game much, i prefer action game with real time battle. BUT! That was me before I met Baldur's Gate 3 last month. The freedom this game provide you will enough to keep you sitting and stay awake all night even though you know you will working 3 hours later. challenging yet relaxing.
9/10

Overall:
This game is way better than your hen*tai games

 [h2] My experience [/h2] 
With 238 hours under my belt, I've become completely entangled in its storytelling, stunning visuals, and characters.

I'm new to Dungeons & Dragons, so the first hours of playing were more than confusing and complex for me, haha. My main motive to play this game was the fact that your choices in this game have consequences - much like [i] Detroit: Become Human, Life is Strange [/i]  , and so on....
I'm a big fan of this concept... so I bought it! ( [b] if only I knew that this game has so much more to offer ♥ [/b])

 [h2] Visuals and Characters [/h2] 
 [b]Visuals[/b]: Visually, the game is a work of art, with many interactive details. (to the point where even in the fith run you will still find something new.)
 [b]Characters[/b]: They're living, breathing beings with their own hopes, fears, and ambitions (and most importantly- backstories). The fact that you can romanc them is definetly... interesting!
Though I've tried romancing different characters in each playthrough, there's something about Astarion's charm that keeps drawing me back, much to my own surprise. As a self-proclaimed vampire connoisseur, I find myself irresistibly drawn to his allure every single time. ˚ʚ♡ɞ˚

In summary, this game is for me personally a masterpiece deserving of its awards, including the prestigious Game of the Year award for 2023!♥ ⋆｡ ﾟ☁︎｡ ⋆｡ ﾟ☾ ﾟ｡ ⋆

This will be rather short as almost everyone has said everything 1000 times already.

Almost everything has been said elsewhere, maybe everything even. I bought this and didn't play it for quite awhile as I wanted to wait on the full release. Watching a few streamer friends play it I decided to give it a try. This is what I've found in 45 hours so far, getting ready to play another 6 or so tonight and probably 4-10 daily for the foreseeable future.

Starting with the cons as I usually do.

Negatives to me -

#1 The most sinful con is no stat rolling will be introduced even after release. This is BG3, the first 2 rewarding those that stayed up rolling all night was an epic part of the game. It should at least be optional, like Solasta (that's right I said it). Solasta kicks your arse on this one aspect. Whenever I meet people involved with the development of this game, which I'm sure that I will, I will bring up this topic, not the gazillion positives. Not having the option to stat roll is TOTAL BS in a BALDUR's GATE title. Most people involved probably never played 1 & 2 (or Icewind Dale, Planescape Toprment, etc. or pretty much anything D&D related ever) or maybe weren't even born yet. Whatever, BS, moving on.

#2 There are some bugs and glitches still which I do not think will be ironed out as they could've easily patched act one again, even this close to release, if they had been worked out. Characters holding weapons incorrectly, ears through helmets, I saw the camera move in a characters head and you were looking at the back of his eyeballs for part of a dialogue, I jumped all of my characters to an area and they couldn't jump back due to a tiny fraction of a millimeter height difference and I had to reload a save an hour earlier (no biggie but sucked and shouldn't happen), some how I bugged some inventory and had 2 of some items - again it was a nice bonus selling but it wasn't as intended and they were unique items so this isn't a case of me being mistaken. etc. etc. Fine tuning is going to be going on for a long time and the worrisome part is that I'm sure they are drooling over all of the gazillion DLC's planned so they may never fine tune the little things further..

3) NPC's talk to whoever is closest to them. That's ridiculous because maybe a persuasion chance comes up and your fighter has to do it just because he was standing close to somebody that started blabbing. I understand if you're controlling the wrong character and you talk to someone but this is different and happens often enough to be a gripe. NPC starts their rant and the wrong person is standing next to them for whatever kind of check is going to be needed. How about assuming the party is smart enough to have the best person for the job do whatever it is that comes up? Like several other games....

4) Maybe this is a non issue at release but there needs to be a ton of voices to chose from for the PLAYER CHARACTER and any custom characters made. All of this time into all of the cinematics and stuff with every origin character and so far there's like 2 male voices and 2 female voices (that's right I said male and female) and funny that they took the time to make sure that the guys can pick female voices and the girls can pick guy voices but only showed 2 of each... Again maybe that'll be resolved in 7-8 days and we'll have 50 male and 50 female voices to chose from. It's just not good when everyone talks the same regardless of gender or race.

5) That's about it for the negatives. A lot could be explained better but maybe it will be a bit and it seems like they want people to learn by trying, trial be fire.

POSITIVES -

I'm not going to use a list here as I'll just do a little paragraph instead. The game is huge, as huge as they all say. My 45 hours I've seen probably I'd guess about 80% of Act 1, that's seeing it from only the perspective of my choices + races + classes etc.. This game is epic in size. They say that Act 3 is the biggest so I expect non speedrun  games should take at least 150+ hours and considering acts 2-3 haven't even been seen yet possibly much much longer. So many options with how to handle anything and everything that it'd be almost impossible to see every single thing in the game. I'd be surprised if anyone at Larian has seen it all. Literally anything could give you several different options based on some optional thing you did 20 hours before which the choices were based on something 5 hours before etc. etc. It makes my brain hurt to think of how much thought they put into all of the different paths to do things. A+ on that and other game devs are going to have a very hard time keeping up with that. Voice acting is great, the best that I've seen and it's all the time everywhere. They must have spent more on voice acting than competing games spent on their whole budget. A+ on that. Cut scenes, everyone knows from watching trailers even, they are stunning. A+ on that. Art/sound/ everything else A++

To sum it up this will be the greatest game of it's type released to date. ZERO competition on that. I'm very confident with that. It'll set the bar for future RPG's so high that it will require very smart and very dedicated people to come close to it in the future. That's awesome for all gamers even if you don't care for this for some ridiculous reason. Studios need to strive to produce awesome work instead of rolling out cash grabs every chance they get. I'm no fanboy, I listed my negatives first. I didn't log in and just fall instantly in love. It's a process. If you play it like an RPG should be played, think about your choices, give meaning to your play through, then you'll love this game. If you want to play it like a murder hobo then you may still like it but there's probably better games for you out there.

If you're considering buying it I would and did. You'll get the free upgrade after release and save $20 or so because of that. It's a deal at this price. I don't want to say what I would've paid for this but if they did the early release as a free weekend or something, I would've paid much more. 

If you read my whole review, which turned out longer than I planned, then thank you for your time even if you don't like it or don't agree.  Comments are on for praise or flames. I'm off to play it so take what you will out of this one. There's only a couple of games that I've felt this good about and I still love and play them so I know this will be a long term love for me, even without the f'ing stat rolls that should be an option.

Baldur's Gate 3 is a masterpiece of role-playing games that will keep you hooked for hours. The game offers a rich story that adapts to your choices and actions, creating a unique experience for every player. Whether you choose to be a noble paladin, a cunning rogue, or a powerful wizard, you will have plenty of opportunities to shape the world and the characters around you.
The game also boasts amazing graphics that bring the fantasy world of Faerun to life. The environments are detailed and immersive, the character models are realistic and expressive, and the animations are fluid and dynamic. The game is a feast for the eyes, especially in the cinematic cutscenes that showcase the epic moments of the story.
The music of Baldur's Gate 3 is another highlight of the game. The soundtrack is composed by Borislav Slavov, who also worked on Divinity: Original Sin 2, another acclaimed RPG by the same developer. The music is varied and fitting, ranging from soothing melodies to intense battle themes. The music enhances the mood and atmosphere of the game, making you feel like you are part of a grand adventure.
The gameplay of Baldur's Gate 3 is extremely fun and engaging. The game uses a turn-based combat system that allows you to plan your moves and use your abilities strategically. The combat is challenging and rewarding, requiring you to think tactically and creatively. The game also offers a lot of freedom and interactivity, letting you explore, interact, and manipulate the environment and the objects in it. You can use stealth, diplomacy, deception, or brute force to overcome obstacles and enemies.
However, the game is not without flaws. As it is still in early access, the game has some visual glitches that can be annoying or frustrating. Sometimes, characters can freeze or become locked in place, preventing them from moving or acting. Other times, characters can clip through walls or objects, causing graphical issues.

It's not a bad game as such, but it comes up short.

There's plenty of positive things to say about this game: The gameplay and combat is pretty good throughout, more or less emulating 5e D&D combat with some changes. The game is pretty nice looking and the production values are generally high even if the over-the-top high fantasy aesthetics don't appeal to me personally. There's some good performances in the game as well and it's very impressive that the game is fully voiced (other than your PC in dialogue, which I don't count against the game). Overall the game is impressively ambitious. Some of these things are something of a double edged sword though, more on that later.

So, while most of my negatives will be very much up to taste, it is undeniable that the game is unfinished. The entire game is janky in every aspect, but the further into the game you go, the rougher it gets. Then it almost completely falls apart toward the end. Performance takes a huge hit, weird glitches and bugs start appearing (both visual and gameplay), quests start breaking, dialogue scenes start breaking, enemies see you through walls, people start conversations with you from a mile away. It's really bad.
Your choices end up having very little impact in the end. Especially one persistent, very foreshadowed choice that you choose to do or not do throughout the game, ends up seemingly making no difference at all. Toward the end NPC interactivity drops significantly, wherein almost every NPC becomes an animatronic puppet barking single lines of dialogue, where you cannot interact with them like you would in any other CRPG. It feels like companions stop participating in the story almost altogether, sans their personal questlines. Some of this is present before the final act as well, but toward the end is where it becomes very jarring. This is part of the aforementioned double edged sword for wanting to voice and animate all dialogue in the game.
It also feels like they cut an entire area out of the final act, an area for which you can see an entrance but can never access. That is fair I suppose, as they didn't manage to populate even what they had with meaningful content, I wouldn't want to see it spread out even further.

But then there's other CRPGs I've loved even though they've had lackluster or unfinished final acts, such as Tyranny. So what are the other problems?

I said that the gameplay is pretty good, but it has its own share of problems. In tabletop D&D 5e, the DM should be careful about making their combat scenarios too large, because the system scales pretty poorly and becomes a slog. Same is true here, and Larian was not careful about scaling their combats. There are many mass combats with way too many participants that end up being tedious drudgery. It becomes even more tedious when the game has its characteristic slowdowns where enemies just stand there for 30 seconds before apparently succumbing to analysis paralysis and skipping their turn. This game is so janky.
Then when it is your turn, you'll have to contend with some very bad user interface and user experience. Targeting your spells becomes maddening when the AoE indicator keeps wiggling and flickering around. Good luck not hitting your allies.
Sometimes the game just kind of freezes for about 5 seconds just to figure out what's going on. Sometimes the game will tell you, you have a 100% chance of hitting... and then you miss 3 times in a row. What?

Then there's the jank of party control, or more accurately lack of control. It's fine most of the time, except when you present me with areas with traps and hazards which are triggered by characters stepping on them, and then have my party step on everything without my say-so. Not to speak of when a party member just decides to stop following you for some reason. Where's Shadowheart again? Oh, she's on the other side of the map standing in front of a chest high wall every other companion jumped on top of no problem. This game is SO janky.
In general the quality of life and usability features of this game are very lacking. Inventory management and looting especially is a bane for the entire game.

I really don't like the camping system. You're just whisked away into a pocket dimension in an instant, a place that is always safe regardless if your camp is in the middle of a dangerous dungeon. No watches, no wandering encounters, no meaningful consideration for resources or safety. This may not be a big deal to many, for me this hurts the immersion of feeling like this is an adventure. For reference, if you want to see this kind of system done right, play Kingmaker. In fact, my general advice is to play Kingmaker instead of this regardless.

Then there's the writing, which is what I think truly makes this game unworthy of having the name ""Baldur's Gate"". It manages to be kind of entertainingly cartoony at best, and pretty bad at worst. The companions are a very mixed bag with middling highs and steep lows. So many of them have a kind of a ""coolest guy ever"" syndrome going on, where they have these incredibly over-the-top grandiose backstories. We're level 1 or 2, and my companions are formerly paramours of gods, right hands of an archdevil and the most notorious warlock-batman of the whole region. It's ridiculous, and so lame. There's a couple exceptions, though. Astarion and Shadowheart turned out to be ok as characters.
Oh and everyone wants to have sex with you, for some reason? I think Larian imagines that the end goal of any positive human relationship is to have sex. It gets even worse when all sorts of otherwordly being start wanting to bonk you as well. It's embarrassing, and juvenile.
The story and writing generally runs the gamut from tropey and shallow, to childishly melodramatic. Plenty of ironic detachment, Marvel-style smug quips, squeecore, and scenes where it feels like you're a receptacle for exposition rather than a character. If you're looking for something with depth, maturity, interesting character dynamics, or complexity you won't find it here. I think pretty early on there was a villain who wanted to kill a kid without a good reason other than she was just that bad? You won't find a character like Jon Irenicus in this game, I'm afraid.
Oh and the humor. I was afraid of seeing Larian -style wacky humor, and Larian provided. Comedy is probably more subjective than most other types of writing, but man the sort of 2010s style random internet humor stuff doesn't work for me at all.
I'm not pretending that BG 1 or 2 were perfectly written. Both had their quirks and clichés, but it was much more nuanced and complex than this, especially for its time.
Another Baldur's Gate games did much better as well was being able to portray a world and place with a reasonable degree of verisimilitude. You felt like a character inhabiting a place in the world. BG3 feels more like walking around a high-fantasy theme park. It seems like Larian really favors having big open maps where everything in the current section in the world is present seamlessly, but it makes plot points like ""None of our scouts can find this place that's next door 5 minute walk away from here"" feel really ridiculous.

I feel like this property was given to the wrong hands, or maybe shouldn't have been given to anyone at all. The game is fun, and impressive in many ways. However, Baldur's Gate deserved better than a 'just okay' CRPG with a big budget, low artistic ambitions, and all-encompassing jank.",1694196027,1694284349,False,210,6,0.75757831335067749,35,True,False,False,True,

I love how Larian Studios put so much heart into this game. They even added an NPC based on a fan's story from Twitter. The fan thanked them for bringing a D&D set that he played with his dad when he was a kid, and they made an NPC that looks just like his dad. It's so touching and shows how much they care about their players.

They also fix bugs really quickly, sometimes within hours or days, which is awesome.

The only downside for me is the same freedom I love. Sometimes it's hard to decide what to say or do next because there are so many choices. It's a bit overwhelming at times.

Amazing story, storytelling, voice acting, and basically all aspects are of sublime quality. A milestone in history of gaming! 

[h2]A party gathers [/h2]
In the opening video your hero is faced immediately with multiple problems. A nautiloid of mindflayers attack Baldur's Gate, capturing several humanoids including you as breeding pods for their offspring by inserting a tadpole in your brain. You must choose how to survive your condition and to stop this invasion, or not. Just like you there are others that suffer the same condition, and together you form a balanced party. 

[h2]The choice is yours [/h2] 
The game is chunkful choices that tailor the game to your style. It starts with character creation, loads of fantasy races and choice between twelve classes based on DnD. There are loads of dialogue choices, even based on character background, and the game offers a solid experience should you prefer an evil playthrough. The game is fully voice acted, so it can never explore every possible option, but it comes very close. 

This game emanates passion for gaming, and creating the best experience possible! It's such a delight to play a game and wanting to talk to everything and everyone, to explore all side quests before moving on the main quest.

[h3]Observations [/h3]
- Larian added waterfalls to every location to prettify them. Works, but feels like a trick. 
- Good and evil are mainly molded by dialogues, but nobody cares about graverobbing or stealing. It would be great if that was part of it all. 
- Sneaking and stealing can be dodgy at times. 
- Game could use a hardcore mode for dialogue choices. 
- Some books give information which isn't always used in the game. Now I don't always allow myself to read everything to the letter. Perhaps hire Amelia extra days to read them all :). Books also could use 'previously read' tag. It would also be fun if misread options would pop up in dialogues. I'm going too deep, I know... 
- The game has some great accessibility options, and I was very delighted it offers an automatic turning of the camera following direction your character moves towards! It's such a powerful tool for handicapped players like me! However, a month ago my game crashed, wiping my settings. The newer patch didn't include this feature, and seeing I was playing on that patch for nearly a week it must be a setting but not included in the interface. I asked for help on the Larian forums, no reply in three weeks. 
- spoiler: [spoiler] It doesn't make much sense how quickly the characters become very very powerful. The whole game takes place in about 2-3 months I reckon? From zero to a devilslaying, bosskilling machine doesn't make a lot of sense. 
- Most big characters receive a big final confrontation, however the halfling trader that we encounter in all acts a bit of a letdown fight. [/spoiler] 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3018717385

100/100

Perfect score?! In my opinion this is the maximum we can hope for at launch in 2023! This is a milestone in gaming history, and will be a measurement for future games. No, a game doesn't need to be bugfree on launch, it's near impossible nowadays. But a game does need rapid patching with open communication towards players. 

This game is a reality check for AAA, we don't want just games filled with buzzwords, we want games built with passion! Big studios certainly have elements of that, corrupted by the coating at the top.

[h2] Roleplaying Elements [/h2]
There have been many great games that truly put you in the driver’s seat without relying on the illusion of control, but Baldur’s Gate 3 has managed to surprise me in this matter. Almost every action you take has consequences. Sometimes, the order of your actions might determine the future as well. This extremely enhances the replayability. The game rewards thoughtful actions and truly allows for role-playing, a term that is sadly misused in many modern games.

[h2] Gameplay [/h2]
The overall gameplay is super rewarding because you constantly see the outcomes of your actions, both in and out of combat. Plus, a great build variety that offers tons of fun as heck experimenting and replayability.

[h2] Voice acting and dialogue [/h2]
Simply marvelous. Every single voice actor did such an amazing job that you can immediately tell each and every one of them did what they did with great passion. Each line of dialogue flows effortlessly, thanks to the amazing writing.

[h2] Story and characters [/h2]
Even though the dialogue is great, the story is one of the weakest parts of Baldur’s Gate 3. It doesn’t hurt the overall quality of the game; however, it is quite clichéd. Nevertheless, combined with a diverse and compelling cast of characters and deep roleplaying mechanics, the story is overall interesting and worthwhile.

[h2] Sound & Music [/h2]
A soundtrack that will surely stick with me for the rest of my life. Hearing “Down by the River” for the first time in character creation and “Song of Balduran” in Act 3 have become some of my favorite moments in gaming. Going back to camp after a hard-fought battle and hearing all these fantastic songs while chatting with your companions—now that is indeed special.

[h2] UI/UX [/h2]
Pretty concise UI that is easy to comprehend and navigate. It is particularly important in a game like this, so I think it is worth mentioning.

[h2] CO-OP experience [/h2]
We played the game 2-player coop, and I gotta say, it was easily the best multiplayer experience I’ve ever had. Super smooth coop interactions and no “host-guest complications” like in many other games. It was a blast debating which dialogue options to go with, who to side with, who to betray, and so on. It truly was a special experience in that regard.

[h2] Bugs [/h2]
A game as big as this naturally has bugs. Acts 1 and 2 were almost perfect; however, Act 3 annoyed me a bit with the bugs. Bugs such as some cutscenes not loading, some enemies not taking any actions, visual inconsistencies, etc. Bugs in Act 3 are worth mentioning, even though they are not game-breaking and didn’t really affect my enjoyment.

[h2] Final thoughts [/h2]
In my 17 years of gaming, I have only had a few experiences that are comparable to Baldur’s Gate 3. I am truly grateful that I got to experience a masterpiece of this caliber.",1705470525,1705530319,True,63,0,0.707566797733306885,5,True,False,False,True,

[h1]Freedom! and Dungeons (and Dragons)[/h1]

If there existed a “correct” way of making a roleplaying game, Baldur’s Gate III is probably it. It tells a remarkable story, featuring characters of depth in a world replete with fantasy tropes that avoid presenting as hackneyed and stale—despite the continued fan proliferation of the world in which it’s set. The combat system is robust; choices made before and after spilling blood are always compelling and occasionally moving. Indeed, the extent to which things are made possible and open to experimentation is what sets Baldur’s Gate III apart from, not nearly, but all of its contemporaries. 

If player immersion is found in freedom, then based on its roleplaying scope alone, Baldur’s Gate III is one of the best games ever made. 

[h1]Methodology of Mayhem[/h1]

Baldur’s Gate III uses Dungeons and Dragons’ 5th edition ruleset. As such, the game comes stock with (mostly) set character progression for all classes. It’s important to note that this limitation is necessary, as Baldur’s Gate remains a Dungeons and Dragons intellectual property. However, character progression still provides you agency over selecting the new skills you want to learn, the feats you’d like to choose, and how you allocate acquired ability points for characters. Even then, nothing is entirely set in stone, as you can re-spec or multiclass as you desire. 

Maybe you want to be a bard? Maybe a bard who’s also a ranger? Maybe even a bard who’s also a ranger who becomes a barbarian? And so on. The multiclassing choices are only limited by the amount of levels you can gain—this number currently rests at 12. And there are also 12 character classes…do with that what you will.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3029245891 

Like developer Larian’s Divinity: Original Sin series, Baldur’s Gate III uses turn-based combat. This is a departure from the original games, but as it is Larian’s expertise, it is welcomed. Order of combat is usually secured by a character’s initiative rating. Assuming you start combat to begin with (stealthier folks may sneak attack a room to death without entering turn-based mode), you’ll choose spells via a radial menu that’s replenished every time the character fully rests at camp. And you’ll want to rest often because many of the story’s characters are developed at the campsite. Battles progress like you would expect, with each class bringing something useful for winning—some support, some attack, and some throw spells. Balancing your party to account for all scenarios possible is recommended, especially on harder difficulties (three difficulty options), as combat can be punishing. Particularly in a battle’s opening, you can get swarmed quickly.

Aside from traditional turn-based combat, the game within the game is really about rolling dice. Without tangentially explaining how Dungeons and Dragons operates, at a base level, game progression hinges on succeeding or failing dice rolls. The die numbers read 1-20; the difficulty of the situation (self-evidently determined [e.g., a bank vault will naturally be harder to break into than a lockbox]) sets the difficulty number. The player must roll a die at or over that number to pass the check; if they roll below the number required, they fail. And it’s not all bank vaults. Dice rolls extend to nearly every playstyle lane—shooting arrows, throwing magic, playing music, intimidating gnomes, seducing half-elfs, and saving companions. The RNG component of this will no doubt frustrate you at times, but some of the finer moments are born from failure. 

My advice: embrace that failure.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3029248562 

The dice can be loaded too. Depending on how you progress your characters, numbers will automatically be added to your die based on your characters’ proficiencies and expertise. As an example, if I need to intimidate a troll, I could get lucky and pass the roll check. Or, if I have added points to my charisma rating, I’ll naturally get a boost to my roll on this check. If I roll 11 and I need 14, but I received +6 based on my skills, I still succeed on the roll despite rolling 11 (17>14). 

The above makes Baldur’s Gate III a meta-game within the actual game. There is always more going on than can be accounted for. And because of that, there’s no way to play the same way twice without saving thousands of times and reloading. Everything feels new and living.

[h1]Knife in the Dark[/h1]

Baldur’s Gate III opens by having you create a character—our first introduction to Larian’s gift of nearly absolute autonomy. Aside from customization of the standard fare (brown hair/blonde, beard/no beard, etc.), you’ll have the option of choosing one of 11 different races owning 31 subraces. Furthermore, the player will also select one of 12 unique character classes that combined contain an additional 46 subclasses, all of which feel viable. You may skip customization and opt to play as any of the seven origin characters that, if not selected, can potentially be recruited later.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3029253087 

I have never encountered an RPG that graced me with this many different playstyles.

[h1]The Road Goes Ever On[/h1]

Set 120 years after the events of Baldur’s Gate II, the game functions as something akin to a soft reboot. Lore, locations, and some characters may return, and previous knowledge may enrich your gratification. Still, there is no requirement of having played the series’ progenitors to enjoy the content held within. 

The story opens with the protagonist attempting to wrest control of a crashing alien ship. Your character, along with future party members, have been taken captive by Mind Flayers—a version of Lovecraftian, eldritch horrors. The ship rips through multiple realms before eventually crashing into the land of Faerûn, where the player escapes. All is not well, however, as the Mind Flayers have infected your brain with a parasite, the removal of which serves the role of the plot’s MacGuffin. And thus, your tale begins.

And, oh, what a tale it is...

Your introduction to Faerûn is swiftly placed in contrast to most video games. There is very little hand-holding or guidance. That’s simply not Larian’s intent. You’re given the tools to progress, to interact with the world, to try things out, succeed, or fail. As an example, if an encountered wall is too high, stack boxes and climb over it. Or pick the lock at the gate. Or knock the gate down. Or teleport over it. Or simply ignore it altogether. Given the sheer amount of tools at your disposal, it’s hard to account for how one might deal with that wall. Or that chest. Or that boss. Or that…lover. You get what I’m saying here, right?

In the past, RPGs’ freedom in progression has typically been measured in the macro. And Baldur’s Gate III cares a lot about that too. 

But it also cares about how you get over that wall. 

[h1]In Quick Summation[/h1]

Baldur’s Gate III is one of the greatest video games of recent years; moreover, it will rank among the truly elite for perhaps decades to come. Even for fans who aren’t typically attracted to the genre, there’s still so much contained within that it’s difficult to imagine there not being [i]something[/i] for [i]someone[/i]. 

The story is immense, the characters are excellent, the progression is satisfying, and the options feel boundless. It’s one of the first games I’ve encountered where I felt that only my imagination was limiting me. And that’s a magnificent feeling.

And Baldur’s Gate III is a magnificent game.

[h1]Rating: 10/10 (Masterwork)[/h1]

The narrative and the charisma of the characters makes you really want to fight for them, unless it's Wyll, sorry Wyll.

Without any spoilers I'd say that it's a fantastic narrative with a wide map, with several choices, outcomes and consequences. Damn, so many consequences. Save often (you will thank me in case you want to please a certain character or did a very very bad choice, or just got a very bad dice roll) and get ready for endless adventures (and some steamy romance, if you are up to it) with the most captivating characters (unless it's Wyll, did I mention already how Wyll's drama and backstory bored me to death?) and enough side quests and stories to keep you playing for as long as you feel like it.

Act 3 however, is where the story falls apart. There is a TON of cut content for it, like the entire Upper City which is missing despite being talked about a month before release. One companion is literally missing a chunk of her questline due to it BEING IN THE UPPER CITY. 

The game also sort of railroads you into good playthroughs, doing an ""evil"" run will have you loose 3 of your potential 9 companions, two of which don't show up until act 3. 

There's also no consequences for using illithid powers, despite everyone acting as though there would be.

In fact there is a lot there to enjoy. I haven't gotten too far but the base combat, the early story, the companions so far all work for me. However the further along I went the MORE and MORE it bothered me that there is no real party/group mechanics for conversations. The whole fact that whoever initiated a conversation (or had one initiated via proximity) is essentially the only character that can do anything and is the one all skill checks are based on just sours the experience in a way that is hard for me personally to move past.

I really like using my player character as the face of the party, but having to rely solely on them regardless of circumstance makes me feel compelled to build them certain ways. Having other characters around with useful skills for situation just sit back and do nothing leads to a desire to save scum. It's also just straight up immersion breaking to have characters who should be stepping in for something just sit back completely useless. It's the kind of thing that really generate a dissonance I personally just find grating.

I'll probably push through the game on a new character more set up to be the face of the party, I'm sure I'll enjoy it, but I'll still having that grating annoyance with something that I feel like should be a core aspect of a party based crpg. Mostly I want to enjoy the more having fun talking about the different choices and such with friends, if I didn't have friends also playing the game I'd probably feel like I wasted my money not waiting until it's cheaper.

This may seem like a pedantic complaint and it probably doesn't affect most people, but it's something that for me personally feels like a core feature missing and bothers me to the point it hampers the experience.",1691273347,1691273347,False,139,5,0.675336241722106934,18,True,False,False,True,

There are no wrong choices. Any option you choose will be satisfying. NPC's will react to the small things you might not even think about. Doing things in very specific ways will result in awesome results that maybe only 1% of players will see; but Larian have put it there, and put in as much effort as they would with any other option! The game rewards you so much for exploration and experimentation. Being horribly evil and going against what would be considered the ""narrative"" in a typical game can be extremely satisfying - you get unique cinematic's and information that other players won't get. 

Your class and race makes such a huge difference. You aren't just a cookie cutter character playing through a predefined story - You really get to CHOOSE. It is any RPG players wet dream. I've played through early access in full four times, and I'm still discovering new things, and I've had wildly different experiences each time. 

Replayability value alone is 10/10. 

This game has been created for the players. The amount of effort that they have gone through to make each choice matter is INSANE. 

GAMEPLAY: 

It's D&D 5e and turn based. This might turn some people off, but I guarantee, if you have ever loved a Bioware game, it is so worth trying out this style of game. Larian rose from biowares ashes like a damn phoenix. 

You can throw people, you can throw objects, different elements interact with each other. Create water, then zap it with a lightning spell to electrocute everyone. Shoot the string that's holding something up, and send it crashing into your enemies. You can set up some incredible fights - if you have an inner tactician, you'll love it! 

You may not like the dice roll mechanic which determines whether you succeed in most things, and it can sometimes be frustrating to consistently fail at lock picking - but there are often other options. Try smashing the chest or door, that always works. But in all honestly, particularly with dialogue, I'd say embrace the failed rolls - your story will be interesting no matter what! But if you really want things to go your way, you can always quick save before starting a dialogue. 

STORY:

I'm reviewing in early access (2 days from launch, GOD I'm so ready) so of course I don't know the full story. But, so far, it's hook is amazing, and your character seems to be caught between a lot of grand schemes. It really does drag you in with a great mystery and serve as a great reason for you and your party members to be together despite your differences (something that any D&D player knows can be a challenge) You'll be tempted by power, with unknown (probably devastating) consequences. The sub plots are great too - I've been drawn into them all and have struggled to exit the game until the early hours of the morning because I just want to see how a story pans out. All of the companion characters feel consistently true to themselves, and it's great. Piss them off enough, and they're not just going to awkwardly stick with you. They'll leave, or try to kill you. 

GRAPHICS: 

Pretty damn good for a CRPG, with cinematics too! I personally find the game gorgeous. The mo-cap for added personality to the NPC's is great. 

COMPANIONS: 

I mean, this will always be subjective, but I'm sure most people will love at least one of the party characters. They have such a range of personality (and alignment) that there will be something for everyone. They're one of the main selling points for me. They all seem to have awesome mysteries behind them, and strong consistent personalities. I feel like their stories are going to be just as emotionally impact, if not more, as the main story. 

The romances feel organic... it's not just ""Get this character approval up with this cheesy way, and get rewarded with a sex cinematic."" (I mean, it's a bit of that, but it feels way more nuanced.) 

The characters apparently know who you prefer based on who you interact with first/the most - and they will react to you accordingly (for example, being less open with you if you go to speak with them last) And as far as my gameplay goes, that tracks. I've had new camp interactions with all of the characters in each of my playthroughs. 

I love Bioware... but I actually think Larian might have won me in terms of character writing. I've only played through act one, and I love them already. 

REPLAYABILITY: 

It's just insane. Play as a different race or class, and you'll already have a new experience. Play evil, neutral, good or a bit of all three, and the story will change drastically. Play as one of the companion (origin) characters, or customise your own origin character that has a fully fleshed out backstory! 

I'm SCARED by the amount of playthroughs I have planned. I can see myself reaching 1000 hrs + on this game. 

ISSUES: 

Sometimes dialogue triggers, and one of your companion characters is used to do the talking. Other companions approval reactions to this dialogue will apply to you, so gameplay wise, it functions as if the player character is talking BUT, you lose the unique class/race dialogue options. This is mildly annoying, but not game breaking. 

There are bugs, but... there are bugs in every game. They're usually fixable, or you can reload. 

FINAL THOUGHTS: 

Damn. This is an excellent game. 

Larian have put player feedback at the forefront of their development. THIS IS HOW YOU DO EARLY ACCESS. Of course they did it for money to help development, but they actually USED the feedback to shape this game into something incredible. 

Players loved a character so much that Larian made them a full companion. 
Players didn't particularly enjoy one of the companions so Larian have announced a rework to his personality/story. 
Gameplay issues that players had have mostly been resolved. 
And Larian have tried to give players as many options as possible in every aspect of the game... 

That whole team has worked so damn hard, and they've created a true labour of love in the process. It is spectacular. 


Would I recommend it? YES. It is worth every penny.

I've started to play back when BG3 was released in early access and was actually not as optimistic at first, as the game seemed quite rough, but i guess that's to be expected.
Now, after full release and patches, it's been an absolute blast to play through the game and immerse myself in this world.

The story starts pretty straightforward - your player character gets infected with a little worm in your brain and after you escape, you seek to find a cure together with the characters you meet and recruit on the way.
A few twists and turns on the way and the whole story evolves into a world-ending event you either try to stop or be part of (The Dark Urge origin ftw!)

Which brings me to a big point of the game: Player choice.
Throughout your adventure, you'll make choices, side with certain characters and/or factions, choose how you react to things and those choices will have consequences, some big, some rather small.
It's definitely a game you should play more than once, to see different outcomes.

But what is choice, if the world doesn't pull you in?
Well, thankfully we don't need to think about that, cause the evironments are beautiful, full of details and there's tons of things to explore and find.
Together with the stellar voice acting and well written characters (some more, some less) you can easily lose yourself in the world. And not just the main characters speak to you, every cat, goblin, owlbear, side-character has a word or two to say to you.
Granted, most of those peripheral characters just have a sentence or two to say, but it does factor into the atmosphere.
And especially the animals are always fun to talk to, assuming you have the skill or potion for it.

Gameplay-wise all characters and classes (that i played myself or have used through party members) feel good and balanced. All with their own way to play and advantages and disadvantages.
And you can either play one of the main characters or create your character in the editor, which gives you enough options to let your creativity run wild.

So if you have a knack for fantasy RPG's, Baldur's Gate 3 is a no-brainer.
But even for newcomers it might be a good entry point, as you also don't necessarily need to have much knowledge about anything, though it helps here and there obviously.

Where to even begin, being fan of Larians last work I stepped in to Baulder's Gate with full hopes of enjoying this adventure and having a good ol' time. So you would be correct in thinking that's exactly the case. The first day of EA was fantastic, the bugs were minimum if any and the performance was decent on a mid spec PC. I was surprised the game ran so well; and with so much of the development ahead of them at this point.

The best part though was the game play and how you interact with the world. The choices indeed mattered here and how you play in this sandbox is totally up to you. But it's not all roses and rainbows. What held this game back was something as important as game play, this being the cast. While their models were fantastic and voiced perfectly, the emotions just weren't there yet. A found family made up of rag-tag team of misfits would usually be the perfect recipe for fun dialogue, emotional depth and inspired scenarios but here I felt that was lacking. But It's only early access and that could be improved upon, getting to know these character well and exploring the story arcs. Which I have high hopes for and is eagerly awaiting.

But going back to what worked, the character creation is fantastic and allows you to play with surprisingly high amount of freedom. The perfect example being my first play through Wizard aptly named ''The Wizard of the Coast-ally Rock''. I like being a jack of all trades and wanted to explore the map to gain a sense of the world which is unfamiliar to me being only a new fan of table top games such as D&D, CoC (the one with tentacles). And a wizard being able to learn any spells seemed pretty fun. 40 hours in... My wizard was a capable of such feats as; Jumping really high (why?), Teleportation (nice!), Talking to animals (okay yeah that's cool I suppose), Talking to the dead (wait what), Invisibility, Changing shape naming a few. Which also meant that I could basically travel anywhere, get past any trouble, pretend to be my enemies and have fun with the fact that I'm my enemy (jinx). So I left my team behind, across the map. Found fish people, found people who eat those people, found a witch doing witch stuff, good or bad? never getting down to finding out which is witch? but always keeping the memories of the ones I left behind... just about a half a mile away. Good fun. Best times.

So where does this all leads to then? Here, now, soon. Today I think. Could be as far as tomorrow...

ACT 1 - Completed (124.1 hrs at review time) - [b]71.7hrs[/b]
(Hotfix #1-4)

So, I wanted to make a diary of each act by updating my initial review. To start, let's begin with what I had issues in the EA. The characters and the lack of unimportant but world-building events. Thankfully I was so pleasantly surprised to learn most of the characters have had a major writing transformation. Some of my least-liked characters such as Shadowheart and Gale are some of my favourites now, Githyanki are still hard to love - I suppose that's lore accurate... But truly the character writing and dialogue as well as their input along our adventure is well crafted and completely natural. Loved every second that I spent with my companions.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3021978691

Additionally, the combat is satisfying as usual, I'm playing hard difficulty and with the Karmic Dice off which means that every battle feels a little more compelling and satisfying to complete. Truly there is nothing else to announce about the combat, it's just great! The world feels a little more familiar as we travel and the new characters get all the more stranger which is a good thing. Sometimes.

It's also big, I've spent the same time I spent in EA in 3 years to complete this first act alone lmao. Is Act 2 just as big? I'm not too sure and also will it be as well crafted as Act 1 which supposedly had 3 years of EA to twist every loose bolt? It's time to find out.

[h1]A 10/10 Act. Simply Amazing.[/h1] 

If Act 1 was perfect then you can be safe in knowing that Act 2 is better than that. But seriously, Act 1 is a 9/10 for me, which is still amazing. Where it lacks were the combat scenarios compared to Act 2 some thing you would only know with the context of continuing the journey. That is to say that Act 1 feels like its purposefully held back, in a level design degree, to not overwhelm the player. In doing so it lacks the amazing set pieces soon to come.

And it should be clear that if this game ended here, as in Act 2 I would be completely satisfied. Feeling as though this is only the first instalment of a trilogy. But it is not so. The story continues and so does the game.

This game is just so phenomenal. The story is great, graphics are stunning and soundtrack is beautiful.

If i had to say only one thing, that this game does perfectly, it's the ""reactivity"" for me. Whenever something noteworthy (or not so noteworthy) happens your companions have something to say about it, they don't just stare at you with blank dead eyes. Same goes with race specific dialogues. Example: if you play as a race that is usually rude to other species and then you treat other npcs well, they are surprised by your actions and they mention about it how rare it is to meet someone like you.I have to mention that i really,really,really loved that one specific optional boss battle that turns into a musical, very charming and fitting. One of the best rpg games in the last 20 years in my honest opinion. 

Allright enough me glorifying everything. Some negative things, performance in act 3 is pretty rough compared to act 1 and act 2. Which is understandable since act 3 takes place in a huge city. I hope they will continue to make the performance there better. Yes that's it, i don't have any other negative things to say.

At first it's overwhelming like all new things. But you will get acquainted with all the mechanics quickly. You might even find yourself a new favourite genre.

Baldur's Gate 3 has surpassed all my expectations and has single-handedly reminded me why I love the RPG genre so much!

Larian doesn't disappoint once again and they have crafted an absolute masterpiece with this game. From the moment I stepped foot into the mystical world of Faerûn, I knew I was in for an adventure of a lifetime. One of the biggest strengths of Baldur's Gate 3 is the complete freedom it offers to players. World reactivity is where the game truly shines, the level of detail and thought put into making the world feel alive is awe-inspiring. Every decision, every action, and sometimes even the slightest NPC conversation can have far-reaching consequences that are felt throughout the realm. The game's storytelling is compelling, drawing players constantly into a web of intriguing plotlines, unexpected twists, and morally complex dilemmas. The writing is top-notch and manages to capture the essence of Dungeons & Dragons game while adding a layer of necessary improvements for all of this to be presented in a form of a video game. 

Larian Studios has gone above and beyond to craft an extraordinary gaming experience from scratch. Right from the start, they've been transparent about the challenges, opting for early access and providing regular updates either via Community notes here on Steam or the ""Pannels from hell"" twitch streams dedicated to their progress, issues, and necessary improvements. Throughout this journey, they've maintained a high level of integrity, steering clear of any dubious practices, price changes, or dishonesty. And the complimentary Deluxe Edition for Early Access owners is just the icing on the cake. Larian's impeccable conduct deserves to be celebrated and prominently featured in the gaming headlines, contrary to the negative narrative we often come across.

Baldur's Gate 3 is more than just a game, it's an immersive journey that lets you be the hero you've always wanted to be. With its captivating storytelling, never before seen world reactivity, and amazing characters, this game truly became my benchmark for what the RPG genre can achieve.

Only partially objective criticism i've seen was that it feels more like Divinity Original Sin 3 than Baldur's Gate 3 , but for someone who absolutely loved DoS 1 and 2 that is exactly what doctor ordered.

But more importantly than how good of a game it is , is that it is a giant middle finger to whole modern gaming industry.

This was a love/hate experience for me. On the one hand, BG3 was overall very solid and proved that a game could be packed with content and love for the player on release. On the other hand, certain aspects of the game itself just did not work for me (along with some plot holes and performance drop in Act 3).

++ Everything I liked about the game had to do with the ""Larian"" aspects of it. That is, the overall feel, the battles, the storytelling.

++ I loved that initial excitement of creating your character and setting off into the world. Most of that feeling was kept through Act 1.

++ Much of the writing and voice acting was fantastic, especially Karlach.

-- Most things I hated about the game involved the D&D implementations. Yes, white knights, I knew it was D&D going into it. I just thought the Original Sin 2 vibe would be enough to keep me happy. 

-- Rolling dice for EVERYTHING got cumbersome. Combine that with such a high rate of failure in conversations and environment checks, you're forced to save scum every 5 minutes. Otherwise, you'd be completely locked out of certain threads. No, I don't want to replay the entire game just to see what an option did. 

-- On that vein:  In OS2, you either had the option unlocked to Persuade or you didn't depending on your stats. In BG3, having large dice bonuses in Persuasion make you feel like you should have a silk tongue, yet you still fail because of crap rolls and ridiculous difficulty classes, leading to a completely avoidable fight/death of a major NPC. Or, on paper your bonuses suggest you're a master thief. One day you unlock a large gate leading to immense treasure and forgotten secrets, the next you're thwarted by a simple box with an apple in it. These types of instances make you feel less connected to your characters and the world around them. Too inconsistent.

-- Resting started to feel like an unnecessary detour after awhile. I got to a point where I was ignoring conversations because I just wanted to finish the game. 

-- While the combat style was fun, the limitations on skill usage got pretty annoying. This is where I missed the OS2 style where you had action points and could use whatever skills that turn as long as you had the points to use them.

-- Having only 12 levels and those thresholds being spaced so far apart, along with some of the levels having very little advancement for your character, took the excitement out of leveling up. That's a huge problem.

-- Some of the decisions I made early on just never came to fruition for some reason, almost like an avenue wasn't considered. For example, [spoiler]I accepted Raphael's contract, and just decided to completely ignore it. I never did anything else involving our agreement. At endgame, there was no reference to Raphael or our agreement..nothing, despite it being a binding contract we made. In fact, in the prologue Karlach made reference to the fact that I was saved. How? We failed to complete his contract and never found a way to get out of it. By all rights, Raphael should have taken my soul. This felt like either cut content or something that was never addressed/considered in the first place.[/spoiler]

-- During the final battle, [spoiler] Zevlor spawned in as an enemy and not an ally. No idea why. I saved him from the Ilithid base even. Played the battle a couple times, always spawned in as an enemy. Made absolutely no sense. [/spoiler]

-- One thing I will knock Larian for is [spoiler]the way they finish games. The last act always feels less engaging than the previous ones across all their games of this style. The ending itself was just...okay bye. I think they even added a couple epilogue scenes to it post launch, but that didn't seem to help the fact that it just fell flat.[/spoiler]

I'm sure there is more I'm not thinking of right now. But it seems like this was not a good place to use the D&D rule set in my humble opinion.",1694789303,1694980448,False,66,2,0.65200197696685791,6,True,False,False,True,

I played BG1&2 multiple times in the early 2000’s, and I played the enhanced editions of both games shortly after BG3 was announced.

So like many players, I’ve been very excited about Baldur’s Gate 3. Unfortunately, this is not the masterpiece that I hoped it would be. While there’s a lot of good content here, there are also a few problems which reduced my enjoyment.

[h1]Combat[/h1]

•	The player controls a party of 4 characters in turn based combat. Each character has action points to move, attack enemies with melee or ranged weapons, cast spells, drink potions, and more.

•	There’s a wide variety of enemies to fight against, and bosses have unique abilities which pose an interesting tactical challenge.

•	I didn’t enjoy act 1, playing on balanced difficulty (the middle of 3 options). Despite the name, its actually unbalanced and frustrating. The biggest reason for this is because most enemies, even the weakest minions, can attack 2 or even 3 times per turn, while my characters could usually only attack once. This feels even worse when I failed the dice rolls, making my attacks miss or do very low damage.

•	The only way that I was able to get past some fights that included 8-10 enemies was to exploit the brain dead enemy AI by going into stealth mode, performing a ranged attack on the closest enemy, then retreating into the previous room, which would usually cause only 2-3 enemies to follow while the rest stood around ignoring the fact that their friend just took a fireball to the face. Kill them in small groups, repeat until the area is clear.

•	However, I’m glad I didn’t give up (like I did with Divinity Original Sin, another frustrating Larian game), because act 2 is much better. The turning point was when my characters reached level 5. My fighter and barbarian companions gained the ability to attack twice per turn, meaning I could actually match the damage potential of the enemies. And like most RPGs, the more you explore, the better weapons and armour you’ll find, which helped to provide more favourable dice rolls. Finally, I was able to win fights without using crazy exploit tactics.

•	By the time I arrived in act 3, my characters had gained more powerful spells and abilities, and my party reached the maximum level of 12 around 20 hours before the end of the game, after which I actually felt a bit overpowered in some fights.

[h1]Other Gameplay[/h1]

•	The character creator has lots of options for class, abilities, background and visual appearance. You’ll also need to create a second character who is included in the story in a very clever way.

•	The interactivity of the world is quite impressive. Characters and objects usually react how you would expect to a spell or an action. You can talk to animals and dead people to gain information or amusing stories. Enemies can be pushed off cliffs to their death. You can use a teleportation spell to reach otherwise inaccessible locations. If you ever think “can I do this?”, the answer is probably yes.

•	You can spend inspiration points to reroll failed skill checks while talking to NPCs, for example trying to persuade them to help you, or while picking locks and disarming traps. (You can’t spend them during combat unfortunately). You’ll earn inspiration points by performing feats that match your character’s background. For example, as I was a folk hero, it usually involved saving NPCs from danger. Your companions can earn them too, allowing you to spend them quite often.

[h1]Story[/h1]

•	Story is excellent and involves a powerful enemy whose plan poses a massive threat to both the safety of the world, and your party.

•	Many quests give you the opportunity to choose which faction or character to ally with, leading to multiple endings. While I was trying to be a hero, save the world and as many people as possible, I think there’s a lot of potential to be evil or power hungry.

•	Cutscenes look quite cinematic, and I like how a narrator describes key events instead of me having to read pages of text.

•	Dialogue is very well written and voice acting is top quality.

•	Companions have interesting personal quests which usually link back to the main quest. I especially enjoyed Shadowheart’s storyline, while two of my favourite companions from the previous games return (eventually) and it was great to have them in my party again.

[h1]Technical[/h1]

•	It took me 117 hours to complete, which means this is easily the longest game (not including expansions) I’ve ever played. While this means value for money is great, overall it might not actually be a good thing. At a certain point I did start to feel like I just wanted it be over.

•	Act 3 suffers from performance issues, with my framerate regularly dropping into the 40s and sometimes even the 20s, when moving or rotating the camera. I have i7-12700K, RTX 3080 10GB vram, 32GB DDR4, so my PC is well above the recommended spec shown on the store page. There are no problems during act 1 and 2, or the parts of act 3 which take place underground, so it seems that the game engine can’t cope with the number of NPCs in the city. Unfortunately the recently released patch 3 didn’t solve this problem for me, and the final battles and cutscenes at times felt like a slideshow.

•	The game has only crashed twice, so stability is good.

•	Some of the following points are minor, but they happened frequently enough to become very annoying, and just make the game feel unpolished, which is surprising considering how long the game was in early access. If this was a shorter game I might ignore them, but imagine how often these things happened over 117 hours.

•	When navigating the environment, sometimes you need to jump over gaps or to reach platforms of a different height. Companion pathing isn’t great when doing this. Sometimes one of my companions would not follow, which would make me have to stop moving, ungroup (so the rest of the party didn’t jump back), select the “stuck” companion, instruct them to jump, reselect my main character, and regroup before continuing forward.

•	The option to hide helmets so that you can see companions’ faces during cutscenes needs to be toggled individually in each character’s inventory screen, and it resets every time a companion is swapped out of the party. Some of the helmets which provide the best bonuses obscure the wearer’s entire face and look quite ugly.

•	Main quests, companion quests and side quests often link together, and progressing one quest will give you information relating to other quests. However, sometimes notes would appear in my journal giving me information that I shouldn’t have known yet, especially in act 3.

•	During cutscenes, sometimes my view of the speaking character would be blocked by scenery because of a strange camera angle.

•	During combat, sometimes an attack animation would play, and then there would be a delay of several seconds while the game calculated the damage.

[h1]Recommendation[/h1]

As a massive Baldur’s Gate fan I really wish I could give an overwhelmingly positive recommendation, but for me Baldur’s Gate 3 does not live up to the hype.

While the excellent story and interesting characters motivated me to keep going to the end, there are major problems with difficulty balance in act 1, and technical performance in act 3, in addition to several minor annoyances.

In theory the problems are fixable, but for now I’d suggest waiting for more patches and a sale.",1696110421,1696110902,True,17,1,0.650352776050567627,5,True,False,False,True,

Loyal to its revered predecessors, this title takes the classic role-playing formula to new heights. The game's narrative depth is enthralling, weaving a complex tapestry of choices, consequences, and character development that captivates players from the outset.

Visually, Baldur's Gate 3 is a spectacle to behold. The meticulously crafted environments, from lush forests to eerie dungeons, exude a sense of wonder and immersion. The attention to detail extends to the character designs, each brimming with personality and uniqueness.

What truly sets Baldur's Gate 3 apart is its strategic gameplay. The turn-based combat system is a cerebral dance of tactics and skill, demanding players to carefully plan each move while adapting to the unpredictable ebb and flow of battles. The depth of character customization and the variety of abilities ensure that every encounter feels fresh and challenging.

Moreover, the game's dedication to player agency is commendable. Choices, both big and small, reverberate throughout the storyline, influencing alliances, betrayals, and the very fate of the world. This dynamic storytelling approach creates a sense of ownership over the narrative, elevating the emotional investment to unprecedented levels.

The companions in Baldur's Gate 3 are not mere tag-alongs; they are fully-fledged characters with their own backstories, motivations, and unique abilities. Each companion is intricately designed, and interacting with them uncovers layers of complexity that invite players to form genuine connections. This fosters a sense of camaraderie and investment, turning these digital allies into essential components of the player's journey.

The companions' reactions and interactions dynamically respond to the player's choices and actions, creating a living, breathing party dynamic that mirrors the unpredictability of real-life relationships. This system prompts players to carefully consider their decisions, knowing that they can impact not only the main character but also these companions who have become integral to the narrative.

Furthermore, the companion system provides an additional avenue for players to engage with the game's strategic elements. Each companion brings a distinct set of skills and abilities to the table, contributing to the complexity of battles and puzzle-solving. This encourages experimentation and fosters a sense of synergy as players mix and match their party members to overcome challenges.

In conclusion, Baldur's Gate 3 is a symphony of artistry, strategy, and storytelling that stands as a testament to the heights that modern RPGs can achieve. It envelops players in a captivating journey, offering a tantalizing glimpse of the limitless possibilities within the gaming medium.

Besides, the Throne of Bhaal had concluded the saga perfectly more than 20 years ago. Why create a sequel to a story that didn't really need one? Whatever the case an opportunity to return to the Forgotten Realms was not one I could possibly pass on. Time passed and Baldur's Gate 3 was released, since then it has been hailed as one of the best, if not the best, cRPGs ever. The bar has been set high. Let's see if I can agree.

The game starts fairly typically with the character creation screen. It follows a tweaked version of D&D's 5th edition ruleset, some of the tweaks, including the changes to character creation, are rather questionable. Alignment is gone and racial differences diminished for poorly defined reasons. Another surprising change was the strangely convoluted way of picking your character's sex, which is that you don't. Instead, you pick body-type and then genitalia. Those quirks aside, I do wish that the character screens in the game would provide better and more detailed information. It was a bit of a shame I couldn't plan my character's development without looking up resources online. Whatever the case, there is still enough D&D goodness here to allow for some interesting characters. There is also a selection of pre-made characters, called origins, which will become companions if they are not selected, and a unique origin called the Dark Urge which puts you in the boots of yet another Bhaalspawn. That one is for a second, more morally ambiguous, run.

After character creation the game begins in earnest with the protagonist captured and infected by the vile Illithid, aka Mind Flayers, doomed to become one of them. Here, the game really goes all out with the spectacle. Amazing Cthulhu-esque characters and areas that look like something out of an HR Giger book litter the prologue. Adorned with epic battles as the flying ship the protagonist was imprisoned aboard fights its way through the Hells. The game deserves all the praise it gets and more for its graphics and visual design. It is perhaps the first thing one notices but I don't think I've seen a classic isometric cRPG that looked this good before. I'm always quick to say that such games don't need to look great, just reasonably pleasant, as long as they play well. But if I can get a game that looks like this and plays well, that's unquestionably better. The experience is elevated further by the game's excellent music and voice acting. The production values are through the roof. This is triple-A meets old-school done right. 

After the prologue, the game follows the now infected protagonist and their party, as they make their journey towards the great city of Baldur's Gate. On the way, they encounter more and more people infected by the Mind Flayer parasites and become embroiled in a suitably grand conflict that may decide the fate of Faerun. The game is divided in 3 main acts, each located in a different area. Early on the player has little knowledge of the grand plot brewing in the shadows and the game does an excellent job conveying this feeling of uncertainty and mystery. It bombards you with questions and gives few answers, which only generate more questions and keep the tension high. Who is your mysterious benefactor? What is the Absolute? Why haven't you turned into a Mind Flayer yet? This early phase of the game was easily my favourite. I was trying to understand what was happening and explore the world around me. A world which is filled with side-content that is still compelling enough to explore even as I struggled with the main plot's great questions. Then I finally got my answers... and I was underwhelmed.

Arguably, the game's greatest flaw is that it doesn't feel like it delivers on its promise story-wise. It sets the expectations sky high and maintains those expectations almost till the end. But I found the final act of the game and the resolution to the story rather lacklustre. Whereas early on, you are given the option to be good or evil, support different factions and see different results, by the game's final act the plot is more or less railroading you towards the same end. Your earlier choices don't matter all that much and in fact it becomes rather clear that the good path is definitely better developed. The conclusion to the story, as well as the reveal of your benefactor's identity left me incredulous and I felt that the whole Mind Flayer brouhaha, including the process of turning into one, was explained in a haphazard way that simply muddled the world's lore. It is a bit of a shame because the final act is easily the one with the most throwbacks to the older games as it takes place in the city of Baldur's Gate itself. 

The characters that can join the player's party are comprised of the available origins that weren't picked, as well as a few extras that come later on in the story. Luckily they are for the most part interesting and compelling to interact with and learn more about. When following the player they will also interact with the world and flesh out the experience, they will give quests, have wants and preferences. It is unfortunate you can only have 3 companions with you at a time, as it means that much of the content of the others will be missed. I would have much preferred if all companions followed the player and interacted with the world, even if only 3 fought with them in combat. It would be no less arbitrary a restriction. A pet peeve worth mentioning here is their romantic aspect. The companions are way too horny and eager to hit on the player, irrespectively of sex. Here you are spending a tender moment with one of your male companions and all of a sudden you are gay. Deny them and you are the bad guy. It's like non-romantic friendship does not exist in this world. Sigh. 

Gameplay wise the game is, again, at the top of its game. There is a lot that the player can do and a lot of ways to do them. The game often feels like a sandbox that invites the player to think out of the box and attempt solutions that don't follow typical game logic. I will admit much of this is not really very D&D-like. The game feels and plays a lot more like an Original Sin sequel, its fondness of elemental terrain included, just with a coat of D&D paint on it. The tweaks in the rules do work generally in its favour here, though I did get the feeling that Original Sin 2 could handle this kind of gameplay better than Baldur's Gate 3 anyway and I'm not without my pet peeves. For example only being able to cast speak with the dead once per corpse and having your opportunity to speak taken away from you if you forgot to disguise yourself first, unless you reload that is, or Larian's bizarre inability to understand the value of heavy armour. Nitpicking aside though, the game is a blast to play, absolutely enjoyable, as well as fairly deep and rich in options. 

So, is this the best cRPG ever made or what? Well no, it's not. It's not even the best Baldur's Gate tribute of recent years, that is Pathfinder Kingmaker. Unsurprisingly, this felt more like Original Sin 3 rather than Baldur's Gate 3. Of course Original Sin is a great series, so that's not necessarily bad, but its focus and playstyle does differ. As such, this merger feels somewhat less focused. I also found the resolution to the story rather disappointing. Not bad per se, just unsatisfactory, it left me wanting. It's a good thing Larian is still tweaking the finale adding extras in recent patches, maybe we'll get there in the end. Be that as it may, this is still an impressively well made game that deserves to be played and then played some more. I absolutely recommend it to all fans of cRPGs out there.",1702025719,1702025719,True,26,0,0.640419065952301025,2,True,False,False,True,

However i have some grief with it. My main problem is its combat system. It feels clunky, stiff and too random. And it is like that, because it is adopted from Dungeons and Dragons (table top pen and paper game) with all it's limitations. I feel like the gaming medium allows for far better systems (developers already made them in previous games).
So let me go through, why dnd combat system makes this game frustrating. When you try to attack an enemy you roll your chance to hit against their defence (or they roll their defence against your static attack value if you cast a spell). These rolls modified by different stats of your character and the enemy, but because enemies get stronger as the game progresses, this hit chance is around the same number, let's say 50%. On top of that, the damage you deal is determined by a dice roll (like 1-6, 1-8, 1-10) before modifiers. So it creates a situation, when you try to attack, your damage is determined by a random number among [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11] 
(all 0's are misses)
So majority of a time you attack does nothing, or very little.
And it would've been fine, if you weren't limited to mostly 1 action per your turn. This means that there is a pretty high probability that your character will make little to nothing impact for multiple times in a row. 

If you are playing a caster character the combat is even worse. All your strong spells are limited by number of times you can cast them before you rest and replenish them. (Strong spells still can be dodged by enemies, or do minimum damage). This is just like in dnd, but unlike in dnd, in BD3 you have combat encounters every 10 minutes. This means that, as a caster, most of the time, you do just normal attacks because you run out of spell slots (or trying to conserve them). Resting after every combat encounter or two seems pretty impractical, because resting advances time in a game and can fail some quests for you.

I know that the idea behind this game was to make a dnd game, and dnd fans would love it. But in my expirience, it's not combat that makes dnd fun, but freeform improvise roleplay players and dm do. And dnd's roleplay isn't possible to adapt to videogame (atleast for now). 
So in the end, video games that try to stay true to dnd feel off to me. 
When you try to adapt dnd, you have this amazing roleplay part that you can't adapt to vidiogame and a below average combat system...

And for Bd3 roleplay, it's just a branching dialogue tree with skill checks. It's great on it's own, but dnd has so much more. Like half of skills in dnd have aplication in roleplay encounters. And in Bd3 you have these skills, but you don't have a use for them.
Like in dnd you have magehand, illusions and others. You have countless ways to use them in dnd, but while playing Bd3, i haven't found a single use for them so far. Didn't have an option in dialogue to use them so far. Maybe you can use ""charm friend"" in dialogue, but haven't tried it.

I guess, my whole review can be summarised with sentence ""I wish, i was playing divinity 3 instead of Buldur's gate 3"".
Because this game feels like a downgrade from an amazing divinity 2.",1691270177,1691270177,False,37,0,0.639543831348419189,5,True,False,False,True,

Amazing story
A lot of interesting characters
You can play as an original character or one of the premade with established lore
If you want to see and do everything, you will have to play the game several times 
Voice acting is top-notch 
One of the best soundtracks there is, especially the vocal songs (Final Act, Down By The River...)
The graphics are just astonishing 
No paywall, no DLCs, no game pass
Ability to reroll your character completely mid-game 
Sooo much customisation of your playstyle that you will never do and see everything 

-
No steam trading cards 
Act 2 and Act 3 bug some quests if you do things out of order which is a huge issue in non-linear game
An accidental right click automatically skips cinematics which sucks 
If you are a hoarder it is impossible to organize your items in camp properly 
Your party rarely reacts to anything in the last act 

+/-
The game pushes you to save scum if you want all the lore (history, insight and other dialogue checks) It would be nice to have an option to skip checks on some difficulty just for lore purposes

[h1][b]Natural 20[/b][/h1]

Video games are very complex. They take elements of producing basically every other art form, and add in the extra layer of making it interactive and engaging for the player. This complexity opens up new, exciting ways to experience stories unlike any other medium. However, video games are [i]not[/i] the most flexible way to tell stories. That honor goes to tabletop gaming, where your imagination is the limit. As such, marketing your game by saying it can replicate the experience of a TTRPG like [i]Dungeons & Dragons[/i] is generally a setup for inevitable disappointment for such a lofty goal, that is unless the name of your game is [i]Baldur's Gate 3,[/i] one of the best games I've ever had the pleasure to play.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]

I would not call BG3 a technical marvel in this category, but there's no denying that some aspects are absolutely remarkable, namely the game's seamless way of blending top-down gameplay and mocap technology to give the game a uniquely detailed look. Environments are diverse and gorgeous to look at, and I love the expressive character designs & animations. I do not have any significant complaints about this section.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

For as much as the letters ""RPG"" are slapped onto game labels these days, [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i] is a right and proper roleplaying game. The character creator is one of the best I've seen in a RPG; there's tons of depth and variety in character builds, with 29 different subraces and 36 subclasses in total, each with their own abilities. It's also well-balanced, even weaker builds are still viable in their own right, both in and out of combat. I also think the game did a great job of translating D&D to a video game format, especially in how it speeds up combat while also staying committed to its tabletop roots by automatically rolling during combat while letting the player roll the die for roleplay-based situations. 

Make no mistake, this game is as wide as an ocean and it's deeper than it is wide. The many branching storylines are consistently well-written, and there's a mind-boggling number of secrets that can significantly alter your playthrough. The game is constantly able to predict and react to whatever insane ideas you have, and choices do matter, quite a lot. Combats can be entirely altered or skipped with a single choice, and your companions can permanently change, leave, or die. You are given several opportunities to gain new abilities and allies, and just as many opportunities to forsake those abilities or stab your allies in the back. However, the stress in picking the ""right"" decision is brilliantly circumvented through the inspiration system (which is taken from D&D, but if you're like any of my tables, is probably not one you use very often), which makes situations more interesting because the game incentivizes you to choose based on what your character would do first and foremost, rewarding you with the chance to reroll in future roleplay encounters. It makes daunting decisions feel a lot less overwhelming while stopping choices from forcing you into a simple good or bad path like a lot of RPGs do.

Of course, a game this ambitious is prone to a few issues. The first is that, despite the remarkable post-launch support, BG3 is rife with game-breaking bugs. I've been softlocked, randomly lost powerful gear, dealt with crashes, and more. I also believe that the third act does have a tendency to feel a little too railroaded at certain points. As an example, Speak with Dead felt largely useless during the act outside of specific segments where it was effectively considering the ""intended"" solution. I understand it needs to conclude the story, but it felt like a lot of the tricks I could pull in other acts weren't viable here for basically no reason. However, these are my only two major complaints with the entire game, and neither of them really tarnished my enjoyment of it considering how well it did everything else.

[h1]Story[/h1]

My personal favorite thing about BG3's story is not just that you're granted so much choice, it's that you aren't shamed for whatever choices you do make. It tailors the narrative to the player, and makes it feel more personal, satisfying, and replayable. Characters are incredibly malleable because of this, rewarding you for spending time with them without punishing you for choosing not to, and there's so many decisions those characters can make on their own that can completely alter your playthrough in interesting ways. They all feel very multilayered, interestingly flawed, and compelling in their own ways. 

If you've read other reviews, you may have noted some critical comments about the game's rushed final act and ending. I would've agreed with these comments up until the most recent patch, which added an extra ending segment that tied everything together in a far more satisfying and fitting manner. I do still believe that the game's third act is a slight drop in storytelling interactivity and quality, as some of the bigger choices felt a little too binary, but the bulk of the act is still very compelling and not even remotely close to the nosedive of [i]Divinity: Original Sin 2's[/i] finale.

[h1]Audio[/h1]

Once again, this is another category where BG3 excels. The music is a standout, with the ""Down by the River"" leitmotif that's present across the entire soundtrack. The sound design is also top-notch, giving spells and other abilities a uniquely satisfying sense of weight. My favorite element, however, was just how incredible the voice acting is. There are tons of subtle mannerisms that make each character come alive in their own way, and play a major role in making them so compelling and endearing. While Neil Newbon as Astarion is the obvious highlight, the depth he brings is found in all of the main cast, as well as a majority of the characters.

[h1]Content Value[/h1]

If it isn't clear from my own playtime or the playtimes of everyone else that has reviewed this game, you are getting the whole package here. It's massive and overwhelming, but the sheer amount of flexibility and choice gives the game a unique allure in replayability and memorability, and I walked out of my ~70 hour playthrough satisfied, yet wondering what I'd do differently on another run, as opposed to feeling satisfied and exhausted like other massive RPGs. 

[h1]Verdict[/h1]

Part of what drives me to review a game is if I believe I can offer a unique perspective on it, as opposed to simply parroting opinions to drive engagement. I hesitated to review BG3 because you've likely heard my opinions on this game from dozens of other outlets and players already. It's a masterclass in interactive storytelling that pushes limits by rivaling the unbridled flexibility that serves as the prime appeal of tabletop gaming, something that I thought was near-impossible for a medium like video games. 

As such, I've realized that this review's purpose isn't to argue that the game is stellar, because you likely already know that. Instead, its purpose is to confirm that praise is entirely warranted, perhaps even somewhat understated for just how remarkable its feats are. No, it's not perfect, because no game ever is, but it surpasses even my loftiest expectations to such an incredible degree that calling it anything less than a must-play masterpiece feels criminal.

Wanted to love this game. I love PC rpgs, have played bg1 & 2, played their earlier game DoS2, I play d&d irl. In many ways its best in class at what it does, and I hope it inspires just as grand competition. 

[b] Abstract: [/b] Baldurs Gate 3 will feel great in the beginning. But once you get deeper into the game the shortcomings become clear. 

[b] The good: [/b]
The gameplay is exemplary. I have never played a turn-based roleplay game where everything feels as fluid as BG3. Other rpgs that I find to have much more engaging writing, like one of my favourites “Tyranny -by Obsidian” falls short when it comes to actually playing the game and taking out your enemies. A challenging task given the complexity of tying 5e together into a cohesive experience. A+

With all your Dungeons & Dragons fifth edition core options, you will be able to customise to a level rarely seen. This is a double-edged sword, which I will come back to. Moreover, 

The graphics is oftentimes breathtaking (forget a few textures) you can recognise detailed facial expressions, giving emotional depth to the game. The closer camera angle gives you a much more immersive experience. 

[b] The bad: [/b]
The game experiences much of the same issues as the last game Larian made: “Divinity Original Sin 2”. Where the game starts great, cool character customisation, innovative options, high detail clarity in appearance, only to break down once you get halfway through the game. It feels like many of the decisions you made along the way, ultimately did not matter that much, or at all. Talking to your companions give you a few lines to say which you deplete rapidly. Not saying every game needs to be at a level of writing similar to “Discord Elysium,” but the problem is when there is no writing at all, nothing to say besides a single option “go back home”. With nothing more to say, you cannot reflect on the monster you just killed, or the people you just saved, or the dilemma you decided (with exceptions for specific times). It feels weird exhausting the dialogue options within a few minutes, only to have nothing to say to people you walk with for spans of time afterwards. Feeling like they are just there to provide a combat role, not to be your parasocial friend imitations. How they react is quite linear; do enough actions they like, few they dislike, then they will bed you as the relation bar goes up, not caring particularly about what you say. Compared to other notable rpgs where dialogue impacts how your relation turns out to be. There is limited character development, if at all, except for situations presented with a dilemma with one obvious preferred choice. 

Little thought seems to have been put into the evil route. You lose out of quests, the better gear, companions. Its just a worse experience with less content. I would think an evil route could tempt you with better options, with the disadvantage that you leech parasitically to a worse ending, with fewer friends. They should learn from the vast library there is out there of villainy. Taken into account, the game is thus mostly linear, even if it gives the illusion of otherwise. In other words; whimsically do side quests and save people = saint, go about your own life not caring for a village or two during your supposedly pressed for time due to threat of imminent death situation = evil. It seems like a crime that in order to experience the game more fully in a completionism matter, you must work against your immersion of time stress. A breaking incentive. At least Skyrim doesn’t claim you to be evil if depending on whether you postpone the main quest to do finish guild missions. As for your “nemesis”, I generally prefer antagonists you develop some sort of personal relation with, possibly with some plot twists along the way. Somewhat spoiler:  [spoiler]but here you do not, only introducing villains along the way with little time to either sympathise or grow hate against. Like the project lead could not make a common thread that ties the story together, but instead making up things as they went. I would favour a more connected story where individual pieces connected as you progress.  [/spoiler]

I fear that they released their game too soon. Thus, it is too late to make structural changes. Their game DoS2 was not fixed in the same way either, where they opted to just remove romance in the Definitive Edition rather than fix the bugs. Given the enormous number of sales BG3 have gotten, I presume it is more likely that they will afford to labour their love for longer, developing their game much more. 

[b] My hot take: [/b]

They should have removed most character customisation, classes, races, only to focus on one in depth story. If you chose the class warlock, where you serve a patron, that relationship should be the pivotal point of the game, not just an extra encounter once or twice to check a box. I want to feel like my class, my race, my background, actually makes a significant role. The game gives you the illusion that your class matters, like when you are using the “speak with dead” spell to get “vital” info from corpses, only to find out the same info in a note on a drawer so that a different class could complete the quest as well, rendering your spell preparation quite a pointless effort. In other words, class mostly changes the way combat works. But it feels like a disconnect when it does not affect the story. It should be obvious that a master swordsman fighter, compared to an arch mage, would have quite different possible outcomes for a task. But here its distilled into slashing with a sword or dealing the same damage with a ball of fire, like a theme/skin with some tactical value. It is a bit ironic that such a customisable experience, offers almost no real impact from your decisions. Thus I would prefer a “Baldurs gate 3 Warlock, Baldurs Gate 4 Wizard” tailored experience. 

I do love that the customisation exists, as it gives quite the modding potential for a tailored story, and works as a sandbox engine for either multiplayer with friends or learning d&d 5e. But for the main story it works against the plot. I would rather be forced to play a specific class for bg3, other than what I would normally be, then wait for a sequel to use a different one. Or they could have gone for the Diablo way, where the game is mostly combat focused so that the customisation does not hinder the experience, but at that point then most of what bg3 tries to do goes down the drain. 

[hr][/hr]

[b] In short: [/b]
If you love the combat aspect of Dungeons & Dragons 5e, or if you want to learn how the system works, then give Baldurs Gate 3 a go. If you expect some grand intricate story influenced by the choices you make, where you develop personal relations with companions, look elsewhere.

TLDR2: [b]If you enjoy the cRPG genre, this game is almost certainly for you;[/b] (and I'm surprised you haven't bought it yet in light of its near universal acclaim, why are you reading this?)

I bought this game on the back of the universally positive reception. I can see why it has its stellar reputation. [b]I believe it deserves its reputation[/b], with a caveat: If you haven't been able to get into cRPGs in the past due to the various dice-based systems, but saw the reviews and thought that this product might transcend your expectations, I think you will be disappointed, primarily due to the prevalence of a large number of dice rolls that can instantly kill you or wipe your party.

I started off having a great time, the world is carefully crafted, the characters I've met are interesting and well written. There are so many options given to the player when wandering the world, from using abilities to talk to animals or corpses to gain special advantages or insight, to (expected for this genre) skullduggery of sneaking, pickpocketing, and lockpicking your way to success.

Unfortunately, as I started to get further into Act 1, I started getting killed by the dice; repeatedly. I found an enemy lying on the ground wounded and, though the game did warn me approaching was dangerous, I was curious about what I might be able to learn from them. The game threw a dice roll at me that I failed, and my character was immediately killed, forcing a reload. I hadn't saved in awhile, so I lost some progress. No big deal, I've learned my lesson, I thought to myself, I'll just save more frequently so that I don't lose so much progress like that again. So I approached the situation differently the next time and avoided death.

Hours of gameplay passed in Act 1. I was still having a decent time, and I was especially having fun talking to people, using my persuasion and clever wits to gain advantages and access new content. I scraped past some difficult fights with enemies that I thought were fairly challenging, and I've have to reload after mismanaging a fight or failing to take something into account.

Then the fights got harder, and harder, and harder. Enemies vastly outnumber you, each enemy gets their own dice to roll against you. More dice against you means they're going to roll more critical successes, which they did, frequently. I encountered a fight near a cave in act 1. The first time I entered the area, my party was wiped on the first round. The second time I was wiped on the first round. It kept happening. Critical success rolls given to enemies with multiple attacks would kill my characters in a single turn. I tried to prioritize the heavy hitters, but could not do enough damage before they'd wipe my party in short order. I gave up and tried to approach the fight from a different angle. I was able to initiate dialog and get one of the tough enemies on my side through my social and magical abilities, and barely squeaked out a victory!

All the enemies dead: [b]Dialog was immediately initiated by the character I had earlier convinced to fight for me with the closest of my party members.[/b] This party member was not my ""designated talker"", failed his dice rolls, and was attacked. Several of my other characters, wounded or dying, were unable to assist. My party was wiped. Game over. The fight had lasted nearly an hour. I'd need to reload a save again. I realized I was not enjoying being killed by the dice. I felt no desire to repeat the endeavor. I closed the game, and I now leave this review.

I might revisit the game again sometime, but I suspect that this type of game is just not for me. I don't have the experience with dice-based combat that could help me succeed in situations like this, and I find the experience so punishing that I do not have any desire to ""get good"" constantly reloading saves to try and figure out what I am supposed to do to progress. I desperately want to experience more of this game's writing, narrative, and interesting choices, but they feel inaccessible to me; gated behind tactical dice-based combat that is punishing and cruel.

My understanding is that in actual D&D sessions, a good GM is responsible for ensuring the players enjoy themselves, in spite of the challenges they are presented. I did not feel like there was a good GM behind the scenes. I felt a cold calculating computer, looming over me with murderous intent, forcing me to reload saves. 14 hours and FIFTY quicksaves later, I am putting this game down, disappointed; and can't offer a recommendation to any of my friends who aren't already in love with cRPGs.",1711827433,1711827707,False,60,9,0.626595616340637207,5,True,False,False,True,

Baldur's Gate 3 is a masterpiece.

I've never been into in DnD but this games has made me genuinely care about the world and the characters who reside within it.

The gameplay is fun and engaging, I really like the visual aspect of rolling dice to determine the outcome in the screen.  
The voice acting is incredible, the main cast of companions are so fleshed out with their own backstories and motivations and damn they are so horny for you.

I've been playing with ""Speak to Animals"" on my bard and I'm still in shock and just how good the animal's voice lines are.
Whether it's a squirrel or an ox or a frog, they've all got something to say, with their own distinct personalities and they actually tie into quests sometimes!

I'm constantly surprised and impressed by the sheer amount of options there are when tackling any situation, and somehow the developers managed to account for them.

I have so many stories about what happened during my playthrough so far
[list]
[*]Somehow convincing, not one, but TWO enemies to kill themselves instead of fight me
[*]Playing the lute to distract a group of people so the rest of my party could steal from their chests
[*]Casting GREASE at every possible opportunity to make my enemies fall on their butt, and then accidentally making my bard sip on the same grease and then blow everyone up with a fireball
[*]Speaking to a sad frog who gave me buried treasure for taking out a hag
[/list]

From now on whenever I think about Dungeons & Dragons I'll think of the way it's presented in Baldur's Gate 3.
This is the ultimate representation of this universe to me.

The best comparison I can think of is the Peter Jackson Lord Of The Ring movies, something that totally eclipses the source material in every possible way - cast, characters, visuals, script, everthing.

I recommend this game to everyone.

Taking your time with this is very much the equivalent of it's own DnD campaign in full. Fully voiced characters, narration, animations and descriptions of everything, it's beyond incredible.

When you think of CRPGs you think of vast branching dialogue options and ""choices have consequences"" which is here in SPADES. But more so they've expanded upon the genre by adding in all these extra things you'd expect of a AAA game, like the fully voice acted characters as well as the narration. 
Animations have not been used to nearly this degree in any CRPG that comes to memory and Larian blasts it out of the park. Using the bones of their previous game Divinity Original Sin 2 by making the world entirely interactive. Wanna pocket a literal barrel of water for a rainy day? You can do that. Wanna stow a corpse away? You can do that. Wanna hum-chuck a candle at a person for damage? You can do that. Wanna go completely off script and do something entirely random? Somehow Larian has already accounted for what the lawful, the chaotic, the good the bad AND the ugly players have thought about doing in this game. 

I had very high hopes for this game, even though I've become relatively jaded from the past few years of disappointments with other titles. But time and time again I'm beyond impressed and blown away by what Larian has accomplished and the entire team that helped put this together should be absolutely proud. 

The story, characters, mechanics, environments... everything about this game exceeds my wildest hopes. I cannot recommend this game enough to anyone who is looking for a genuinely GOOD experience in a video game.

I am so torn about this game because Act 1 and 2 are incredibly good. Act 3 is such a bug riddled mess that I cannot believe it ever made it to launch. Performance is terrible. Every time I throw a weapon, I don't get the animation for throwing the weapon and the game freezes and I have to find out how much damage I did by reading the combat log. Almost every quest I tried to do in Act 3 had some sort of bug: the firework shop quest is broken and the only way you can resolve it is by killing everyone, talking to major characters sometimes doesn't give me all the text options and bugs out like the first time you talk to Devella, and the thing that finally made me write this review is that I threw my legendary weapon at a target and it just disappeared forever forcing me to reset to my last save.

At the time of writing this review, I have powered through an incredible amount issues (especially for a game with this level of critical acclaim) to get to ACT 3 on the hardest difficulty. Simply put, I believe that this will be great in 12 months [b]if[/b]  the developers spend their time wisely - not only fixing the rest of the bugs, but addressing the devastating and crippling performance issues. 

To provide some details, here is a snippet of what I have experienced (I don't have the best PC in the world, but it relatively high end. As a benchmark, I can run most of the latest games in 4K ultra with high FPS):

- An average of a crash every 4 hours of gameplay, which means I have seen around 2 dozen crashes. Yes, I have tried troubleshooting with everything that Larian and the community has suggested...with no luck.
- Combat will pause no discernible reason. Your attack will be delayed by 10-15 seconds. An NPC will do nothing while the model gyrates in position.
- In Act 3, the part of the game that you have been looking forward to the most...the performance is [i]abysmal[/i]. The game will completely freeze up for 2 solid minutes. FPS will drop a fraction of the previous averages. NPCs walk around aimlessly in circles, etc.
- Yes, there 60-90 second load screens and the game is 120gb, but honestly that feels like nothing compared to the other issues

But, the worst part is the ""A death by a thousand cuts"" core gameplay experience. The game just feels tedious. A few examples:

-Your companions refuse to follow you correctly and you have to switch to each one individually just to get them to jump over a 1m ravine. 
- Double clicking on companions portrait to switch control works 50% of the time. 
- You try to select an enemy twice in a row, but because the miss animation wasn't done, your character shoots the ground.
- The camera. Oh my god the camera. Doing battle inside of buildings, with multiple floors especially, is incredibly frustrating.

The core of BG3 is a phenomenal, ground breaking, and deep RPG experience. There is simply a unprecedented amount of freedom to control both the narrative and your gameplay.

Baldur's Gate 3 may not land in my top 5 favorite games of all time, but it certainly lands in the top 5 most competent, well-done games of all time. It's incredible what they've accomplished and I truly believe this is a game all fans of RPGs should play. If you can't afford it now, get it eventually as you won't regret what you experience.

Now that said - the game is not perfect. While it is subjective and on preference, I personally did not like a single one of the characters and had a hard time really meshing with them throughout a lot of their team/companion interactions. Especially romance. If you don't like the characters, the romance feels sudden, out of place, forced, and downright funny at times. That said, it's such a minor thing that don't let this dissuade you ... unless you were looking for a dating sim in which case I have no clue how you got lost here. 

I also found that I wish I had more options for merchants, selling, or trading earlier on in the first 1/3rd of the game. I was leaving stuff behind all over because I had nowhere to offload my loot/inventory. While this does track with Dungeons and Dragons gameplay (which is heavily involved with the Forgotten Realms world). Unless you have a pack mule or cart/wagon of some kind (which never happens), it doesn't make sense that you can carry that much. Even with a full party of people, each with their own inventory capacity. Maybe I'm just a fiend for loot but it did frustrate me on a few occasions. 

Otherwise, I failed to find much else wrong to complain about. The game is beautifully made, written, composed/scored, and has a satisfying end-game and conclusion.

I like games that:
1) reward clever and careful combat while punishing mistakes and lack of preparation
2) reward exploration, observation, memory, and creativity (If you need, or feel like you should have taken notes, this is a good sign of a mature and rich game)
3) allow a variety of play styles, moral alignment, and offer significant role playing opportunities, all of which culminate in different paths through the game and different outcomes for the world and the player-character.

Both Larian and FromSoft understand that a combination of many very well executed aspects of game design contribute to an experience that is more than the sum of its parts. There is some sort of emergent magic that happens when such care and thought is put into the initial design, even when some aspects of the finished product leave something to be desired.

Gameplay is excellent. Combat is clear and precise. It rewards preparation, creative approaches, and punishes sloppy play. Resource management is crucial. Combat is extremely accessible, as it does not rely on reaction times, mechanical skill, or extreme practice. Anyone who can observe, think, and operate a mouse can play this game well and have fun with it, without intrusive or demeaning accessibility options. The inclusion of a difficulty slider actually works well in this game. Difficulty sliders often ruin the experience, as they merely introduce absurd artificial difficulty or handicaps. Skyrim is a perfect example of this, as Legendary difficulty doesn't make the game harder, it just makes it more annoying and more time consuming. BG3's difficulty slider alters the AI, their perception, and their tactics, in addition to balanced and fair adjustments to hitpoints and damage output. There is also an honest player's hidden difficulty adjustment: the frequency of saves and reloads. The game can be MUCH easier or INFINITELY harder based on how often saves are made.

The world of BG3 is so incredibly rich and enthralling that it feels endless and bottomless. At the time of writing this review, I binged my first playthrough and cut significant corners towards the end, creating a backup save at a certain point of no return to experience a different ending and tie up some major loose ends. I would estimate that a completionist playthrough would take well over 100 hours. A quick playthrough of the game would likely be 30-40 hours, and would be difficult to achieve on a first playthrough without missing significant content. I do appreciate that Larian is willing to allow the player to miss significant content. They are leaving 'excess value on the table', which is the real mark of a generous and passionate developer.

My first playthrough was a Dark Urge background character, where the character is overwhelmed by murderous impulses and crippled by amnesia. The number of different outcomes in this character background alone is absurd. The number of alterations to quests based on my class alone is absurd. The number of different game-altering choices that I was allowed to make, both to hinder and help me, throughout the game was absolutely insane. TRULY, no two playthroughs will be alike. The only way that one could have an identical playthrough is if a save were duplicated.

I have only a few small nitpicks: 
1) The UI leaves something to be desired, particularly the inventory. I wish ""pockets"" had been implemented, where various items would automatically sort themselves into user-defined categories. I often find my inventory filled with scrolls and arrows, with pieces of armor, story items, and interesting trinkets mixed in. The camp/global storage is a wasteland of collected junk, one-time-use special items, wares to be sold, books, and lore pieces.
2) I find that alchemy is a bit under-utilized. I wish a more general guidebook, perhaps with species and farm locations, could be filled as the player progressed through the game. A small rework could significantly improve this. I love the inclusion of the system, but as only 20% of players have created 3 or more potions, it does need some attention.
3) Quest pathfinding could use a bit of attention... Often when entering/leaving a building, the quest marker will direct the player back in the direction they just came from. One particular quest towards the end of the game required me to look up the location of a certain... maligned NPC atop his Rock.
4) A turn-jump mechanic would be useful when many enemies are in combat, such as during a particular encephalitic encounter. This would be especially helpful when allies or enemies are separated by great distances or other area barriers.

Larian is now another developer that gives me hope for the future of the industry. No microtransactions, no subscriptions, no BS. Just a pure, passionate, and rich game that kept me engaged for my entire playthrough, and will provide many more hours of fun on subsequent playthroughs.",1709012475,1709013376,True,7,0,0.620253145694732666,0,True,False,False,True,

This is the first Baldur's Gate game that I've ever played. I wasn't that interested in the story of this game or previous Baldur's Gate games, so I skipped them and went straight to this. I personally wanted to play this game to experience what everyone was speaking about; the way you can approach each quest and shape the world. And for sure, it met my expectations.

The story of this game is pretty average, but no offense, to me personally all these RPGs have similar generic stories (gather the allies and beat the evil). And that is fine, it's just not for me. However this game does add some ""unique"" stuff to these classic stories, but the characters are mostly bland till the third act, and I didn't care much what would happen to me or my companions. In Act 3 (the final act of the game) they became more interesting because this is where all these companion quests end. The funny thing is that most people seem to hate the ending, and I personally found it interesting. It's different, the bitter-sweet as my friend Dean said. Could be improved of course.

Now let's talk about the most important stuff regarding this game. There are many games where you can make choices, and where you can attack friendly NPCs, but what this game offers is that you can kill NPCs and they will literally stop existing. All quests related to them will disappear. I for example had an issue with one boss, cause he was killing my companion in the dialogue as soon as I approached it. I had no way to save him, so what I did is that I attacked him with a bow from a distance which triggered the boss fight. Killed the boss and my companion stayed alive. Some guy even managed to kill one of the main villains literally 10-15 hours before the final duel teleporting the enemy somewhere else and pushing them off the cliff, which caused the mission to be successful. And it's not just about killings. It's hard to even explain it, you need to experience it yourself.

There are many ways to approach the quest like I said, but there are also issues. For example, in Act 1, SLIGHT SPOILER AHEAD there are 3 goblin leaders, whom you need to kill to save some people in the camp led by Zevlor, and the first time I played the game I killed them after speaking with Zevlor, and getting quests from them. This time I decided to kill them first. This is good right, you can do it whenever you want. However, my issue was that after killing them and then talking with Zevlor for the first time, he didn't seem really excited. He just said hey I heard that goblin leaders are gone, here are coins for you. There was barely any dialogue. After I met him in the camp, he was just standing there, without any option for me to talk with him. My point is, if I finish the game again, I am not sure if there will be too much variety since I will probably do the quests a similar way, or in a lot of cases the same. It's mostly if you want to be a good or a bad guy, rare are choices where you actually have to think; one of the exceptions is the ending of one of the companion's quests. That choice really made me think, probably one of the best choices I saw in gaming. But for the first playthrough, this variety is amazing.

As for companions. I may get some hate for this, I personally don't have anything against people who are attracted to the opposite gender, however, please don't rub it in my face. In the beginning, I was scared I would select the wrong dialogue option because every male companion was hitting on me. Mage told me ""Hey come here to see some magic"", and I was like sure, he is a mage, he probably wants to show me real magic. But oh boy, I was wrong. I immediately reloaded the game. However, after you reject them a few times, they stop trying. But the beginning was a bit annoying. Especially the Astarion, the gay vampire who is constantly trying to suck you. I mean your blood.

The gameplay-wise, this game follows the 5e dnd ruleset. Every time you attack game will toss dice in the background (you can't see it), and based on what number it lands you may land an attack or miss. However, when you make some choices in the dialogue you will be asked to toss the dice, and the rolling of the dice will be shown on the screen, which is pretty cool. If you get a high enough number you will perform what you chose in dialogue. Otherwise, it will fail. This way you can talk yourself out of some fights, by getting good numbers. Combat is turn-based, which I personally found pretty fun, having never played a turn-based game before. The game wasn't that hard, but wasn't easy either for a turn-based noob like me.

It took me around 100 hours to beat the game, and clear most quests that the game has to offer. Performance was fine until Act 3, where it started dropping a bit more, however, I can't say that I cared too much, because it seemed optimized enough. The atmosphere and music are really average.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
- Amazing way in which you can approach the quests and shape the world
- Companion quests are pretty good
- Fun gameplay and the combat itself
- Interesting ending

[h1]Neutral:[/h1]
- Story is average
- Companions are okay, but a bit bland at first
- Performance is mostly fine
- There are some bugs, but it wasn't that bad in my experience
- While the ending was interesting, it could have been done a bit better
- Variety could be even better regarding choices, in most cases the choice is if you want to be a good or a bad guy, however, there are some ""hard"" choices which I enjoyed

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- The main villains of Act 3 are cringe

[h1]Verdict:[/h1] In my opinion mechanic-wise this is the best RPG I've ever played. There is nothing like it on the market at the moment. The way you can play the game and shape the world is just amazing. For this reason, I would recommend this game. Sure, some stuff could have been done better, but in the sea of generic games coming out every month, this game is amazing.

So when I started playing this game in full release, I already knew it was going to be pretty good. But the full release was far better than my own expectations. This already is most likely one of my favourite games and I have yet to explore other possibilities ingame. 

The finale of every act feels so rewarding after all your efforts. The details in every zone are amazing, i found myself exploring every single room and corner of the world and collecting books, notes and other papers full of lore. 

My favourite Act was definitely Act III but not to say Act I and II were bad. It was because of the previous Acts that Act III made sense and felt so satisfying. 

My favourite arc (if you can call it that) was House of Hope or Raphael's arc. I'm sure most of the players agree they enjoyed his song during his ""boss fight"". This poetic devil named Raphael is one my favourite characters. I think he and Mizora truly represent what we know of devils. (Nice detail on 666HP). Hope was also cool, wholesome and funny. How am I not gonna save her during my evil run...

My favourite companion is predictable I know, but yes Shadowheart and I am not talking about romance (only). Every character really developed during the story and trying to solve their own personal problems while fighting together to solve their common problem, the illithid tadpoles stuck in their brains and saving the world from the Absolute (or not depending on your choices). Most characters (even NPCs) have a story, a personality, a opinion of their own, So sometimes, if you are making certain decisions, you might not just be affecting the main or secondary characters but also a ""random"" NPC walking by.

Cinematics were amazing and well planned. I used screenshot a lot!
I hope the voice actors of this game were payed good. The characters felt so real with their emotions and personalities. The team who worked on expressions and body language helped a lot to give the characters life of course.

A few extras I feel the need to say:
Shadow isles was the hardest part imo. It did indeed felt how hard it was to live in those conditions and the amount of destruction in the various places of the map caused by the curse. But again all that to satisfyingly reward us with a lot.
Karlach's ending made me want to cry no matter the ending you chose (cry from sadness, relief or joy)
I'm not sure if I missed stuff in the previous Acts, but Act III felt the longest one. It was probably intended.

I think thats all? Thanks for reading and for the patience!

There were several moments during my playthroughs - two, so far - where my jaw dropped or I cried or laughed out loud or had to stop and just stare at the screen in utter disbelief at what my actions had wrought. How dare you, Larian Studios, make me face CONSEQUENCES?!

Divinity Original Sin II is one of my favourite RPGs and I knew that Larian would deliver an outstanding feat with Baldur's Gate 3, but didn't expect it to be nearly as good as it is. I'm glad to see the attention it's brought back to the cRPG genre and to story-heavy games that greatly emphasize quality and player experience rather than profits.

Act One plays like a dream, but as is often the way with these, problems don't start to show up until you've already invested too many hours to write it off.  Holes start to show up in Act Two, from little things like blank textures and mid-combat freezes to bugs that make it fully impossible to progress like missing quest objectives and a disappearing UI.  By Act Three simple things like walking down the street in the titular city are enough to cause loading issues, and you'll wind up restarting constantly just to push through to the dialogue.

Now, important to note, some of this might be my computer; it's new this year but it's mid-range for specs, and this is the newest game I've played on it to date.  But a lot of these bugs are simply unaddressed, and if you look them up when you encounter them you'll find years-old forum posts from when the game was still in alpha detailing exactly the issue that's been left in the full release.  Any game this massive is bound to have things fall through the cracks, but game-stopping glitches that simply block the player from completing storylines that obviously had so much care and effort go into the writing of are just appalling.

It's a damn shame because for the third of it that's finished, it's fantastic, and seems like it will continue to be until you hit a certain point.  I've unironically enjoyed restarting and playing through the first part with half a dozen different characters, it's that good until it isn't.  But given that some of the later bugs are years old and haven't been fixed, I wouldn't be optimistic about a timely patch fixing them before most players either force their way through to the end with constant restarts and unfinished plotlines or just give up and quit the game to move on to something else.

Story is beautifull, graphics is stunning - i was waiting so long for this game.

Ladies, gentlemen and everybody in between, after twenty-two long years: [i]Baldur’s Gate III[/i]. Over a century after defending the titular city from the wrath of Bhaal, deity of murder, a new, terrifying plot unfolds – illithids, brain-devouring psionic entities, threaten to add thousands to their foul ranks by transforming unwilling hosts into twisted abominations. And that’s where you come in.

[b]THE GOOD[/b][list]
[*] Despite all aspects in which the third instalment differs from its predecessors, a truly epic journey remains an undisputed constant in the series. The plot is humongous, complex and multi-faceted, presenting many opportunities to branch out accordingly to your choices. Apart from the obvious illithid theme from the get go, there’s a couple of other major plot points – including well-known factions operating throughout the Forgotten Realms and intriguing references to Bhaal’s resurgence over a hundred years ago – that may seem disjointed at first, but come together exactly when the time is right.
[*] All of it happens in a highly interactive world that’s being shaped accordingly to your actions. Most major plot points can be tackled in multiple ways that are distinct enough to contribute to creating a unique playthrough. The game never tells you how to deal with the story, the world and its inhabitants. Whatever path you decide to follow, there's always choices, as well as far-reaching consequences – including removal of a whole faction, being hunted in certain areas, gaining favour of powerful entities or even being surprised by premature closing credits. It's all up to you.
[*] Since travelling alone can be boring, ten recruitable companions are here to keep you occupied. Most of them are very well-written, sporting deep backstories as well as multidimensional personalities. Their unique quests stretch throughout the whole game, often intertwining with the main plot and its subplots. And while they may start as goodies, baddies and in-betweens, it's the player's choices that catalyse their development, potentially changing their worldview to great extent. One reservation, though: where's my dwarf companion, Larian?!
[*] For tabletop RPG fans, the game may feel like a long, thoughtfully crafted campaign. The Narrator, who guides the player, provides additional insight into the Forgotten Realms' lore, characters' emotions and struggles, setting up each scene like an important part of the story. And once again, the writing really deserves all the praise. There's very few duds in quest-related content, the characters you meet on your way are believable and dialogues most often exhaust all necessary options to roleplay your heart out.
[*] And if you're here for a taste of digital D&D, rejoice, because it may be the first instance of a 5th Edition rule set done right in a video game. With no unnecessary complications or departures from the tabletop system, it's an accessible title for both fans of D&D 5e and newcomers. Veterans may be positively surprised at how accurate the translation is and those new to tabletops may find the mechanics user-friendly. In addition, there's many class and racial options to pick from, a number of abilities and level-up improvements that isn't overwhelming, familiar monsters and a wide variety of items, both ordinary and enchanted. Definitely a good example of a digitised D&D game.
[*] Turn-based combat is somewhat smooth, puts emphasis on resource management sensibly reducing the impact of luck on the outcome (dice rolls are still a thing, obviously) and allows the player to approach every combat in a different way through the use of covers, environmental hazards or... picking up an enemy and throwing it at another one. Because why not?
[*] If Underdark sounds scary to you, just wait until you get to see it. It's just one of many locations that are worth sightseeing – as soon as you're finished trying not to die, that is. Game's environments look stunning. Aforementioned Underdark brings out the feeling of delving into a gloomy place of dire reputation, the city of Baldur's Gate is huge and greatly detailed with multiple distinctive sub-areas, and another planes of existence that you visit show a good representation of the Forgotten Realm's variety –  both in terms of used ideas and gorgeous visuals.
[*] With a great work from the Narrator, flawless voice acting breathing artificial life into NPCs, ambient sounds strengthening the power of immersion and an epic, orchestral soundtrack, Baldur's Gate III is truly a sonic feast.
[*] Inclusivity done well. There’s multiple characters that represent various minorities, break prejudicial or unnecessary stereotypes and just naturally belong to the game’s world and story. In no point the representation feels harmful to its actual real-life equivalent groups. Long story short: you certainly can feel good about yourself in Baldur’s Gate III, regardless of who you are. Just be yourself.
[*] It’s a complete game (except for what’s stated below). The dev team showed that a game can be not only playable, but enjoyable on day one, that you don’t need microtransactions or a dozen DLCs that consist primarily of cut content to gain players’ interest and their money. With feedback being constantly turned into patches, I believe there’s still many more improvements to come to what’s already a great product.[/list]

[b]THE CHAOTIC NEUTRAL[/b][list]
[*] The further you go, the wonkier it gets. The game is split into three humongous acts. Act 1 is by far the most polished, which shouldn’t be surprising considering it was available in the Early Access. Act 2 is very solid as well, although in later parts I was already tired with its omnipresent gloom. And then there’s Act 3, a chaotic blend of greatness and undercooked content. While it’s definitely still a ton of fun and most things work as they should, if there’s bugs to encounter, Act 3 is where you will. Some of the quest lines are too intertwined, breaking other tasks if they’re not finished in a proper order (that you cannot know of), there’s content that feels shortened in a rush (to release the game earlier) and then there’s the ending...[/list]

[b]THE (L)AWFUL EVIL[/b][list]
[*] ...oh, the ending. While the very last minutes of the game don’t undo the whole joy of playing, but calling them “unsatisfactory” is like saying nothing at all. All grand revelations happen way earlier, so the very ending lacks absolutely anything to think over. You emerge as a new hero (or scourge) of Faerun, stand in the light of a new dawn… roll the credits. Have your choices changed the world and people you’ve encountered? Except for the obvious “everyone is saved” or “everyone is screwed”, you don’t get to know. Is Faerun preparing to rebuild after its nigh-devastation? Uhm, maybe? How about your companions, what happened to them after the game’s events? In most cases, it remains a mystery. Did you want the ending slides for an expanded epilogue? So did many people, it seems. Unfortunately, these weren’t delivered and nothing was put as replacement. Bummer.[/list]

[b]OVERALL[/b]
Despite its lack of polish towards the later parts, it still IS as good as the Internet suggests. Mechanics – spot on. Story – engaging, intriguing, multidimensional. Companions – deep, likeable. Narration – outstanding. Sound – beautiful. Visuals – on point. High replayability with easily a hundred hours of playtime. It’s a full game with no development or release BS. The devs are still working on patches and communication with the player base is spotless. If you like RPGs, go for it. If you thought the brilliance of the Baldur’s Gate series couldn’t possibly be brought back after so much time – think again.

Finished two runs of the game so far, but it feels like the quality of the characters and writing falls flat in act 3. Act 2 is already a lot less substantial than Act 1 was, but 3 just feels unfinished.

The character design and writing feels like the strongest and most interesting part of the game, with combat also being very dynamic and well put together. With this, Act 1 was full of interesting dialogue and choices for even minor interactions with non-essential characters. Act 2 has some awesome high points and some incredible moments. Act 3 has neither of these strengths and I felt almost badgered by a few specific NPCs.

Heavy Act 3 spoiler, do not click this if you haven't finished the game, you have been warned:
[spoiler]I'm also upset at how the game just railroads all character choice part way through act 3. Regardless of your decisions, who you choose for allies, or what outcome you as a player were aiming for it all comes down to two decisions. A lot of the massive previous decisions and NPCs just force you to pick between these choices. 

For example, regardless of your choices with Orpheus, The Emperor, The Grove or the Absolute, Kagha, Raphael etc you are going to be railroaded into dealing with Gortash in one of two ways. Watching all paths converge for no narrative reason felt like every decision made up until that point was futile and all of the meaningful choices I thought I was making became irrelevant. [/spoiler]

There are a lot of good parts of the game and a tremendous amount of detail put into small and often overlooked parts of the game, but I still think the aspect of the game that carries it the most is the story and the writing. For that to fall apart in Act 3 has left me with mixed feelings about the game overall.

Act 1 is a 9.5 / 10.
Act 2 is a 9 / 10.
Act 3 is 6.5 / 10.

Hopefully either more content updates or DLC will expand upon Act 3, but ultimately the game still feels like it was released 3 to 6 months too soon.

Also, I've avoided mentioning the plethora of bugged quests or interactions that are most prevalent in Act 3. There were 2 broken interactions we encountered in Act 1/2, but in Act 3 we had countless. Even as far as a quest that ""completed"" after we accepted it, giving us the reward and completing it in the journal but the quest giver continued to give us dialogue as if we only just accepted the quest and the actionable objectives were removed from our world.

Bugs both can and are being fixed. In a game this size, I think it's reasonable to assume there would be bugs. Poor narrative and writing in Act 3 is substantially more time consuming issue and I'm not sure it will improve anytime soon.

Overall, the game is a 8.5/10. It gives the same vibes as a great TV series that runs out of gas in season 5 or 6.",1691920268,1691920650,True,9,0,0.616211533546447754,0,True,False,False,True,

This was disappointing because Act 3 is the most interesting part of the game and is narratively the most important. 

Characters who are clearly dev favorites are given an inordinate amount of attention, whilst some other characters remain stuck with odd, disjunctive character development, or remain underdeveloped in Act 3. All in all, this game was promising but did not live up to the hype.

Even after all the 3.0 bugfixes there are a million fucking broken things in this game. I want to recommend this game to anyone who has an interest in RPGs, and it would be one of my favorite games ever if, again, it fucking worked. 3.0 made the game a lot better but it looks like it still has months to go before you can complete a playthrough without running into a myriad of bugs that will break individual quests or entire storylines, not to mention the incredibly janky pathfinding and line of sight issues that make moment-to-moment gameplay a complete pain in the ass. Inventory management in this game is some of the worst I've seen in modern gaming and the recent patch somehow found a way to make it even worse.
At least they fixed the framerate and stability issues. 

It might seem like I'm making a big deal out of nothing, after all how much can I dislike the game after playing it for 150+ hours and saying it's one of my favorites? But I'm sick and tired of modern developers releasing horribly unfinished games, and once I've already given them my money (oops) the only means of recourse I have is leaving these negative reviews. 

If you have a job and work 40 hours a week, and then the game you play to have fun wastes your time with bugs that undo hours (or dozens of hours) of progress, I think you have a right to be pissed. I know I'm an old man shaking my fist at the clouds, but I remember back in the days of the N64 and Playstation 1 when bugs in games were things you found rarely, and were usually mostly visual. The worst thing you could find back then was a save getting corrupted, which really sucked but was something I encountered maybe once or twice in a whole generation of consoles. These days I can't go 30 minutes without finding something that doesn't work the way it's supposed to.

I want to remind everyone: the way that you turn one of the ""good developers"" like Larian into lazy cashgrabbing dickheads like Blizzard is by showering praise on them and saying ""shut up and take my money"" for a game that wasn't even close to being ready to leave early access. When devs figure out they can get tons of profit and prestige from releasing unfinished games, it creates financial incentive for them to cut corners and release an even less finished product for their next development cycle.",1694159958,1695717024,False,74,5,0.613208174705505371,0,True,False,False,True,

This was my first time playing a turn-based game, and while at first it was a bit hard to adjust, it quickly became the new norm. The game and interface is easy to pick up once you're playing, and you'll quickly come to understand the game/game play as you go. On top of being my first turn-based game, it was also my first experience with the D&D concept, and I'm honestly hooked.

The graphics are beautiful, with an impressive attention to detail - I have played this game on all ultra settings continuously without any major issues (other than a bit of pc warmth), and it's been fantastic. The soundtrack is fitting to the game and works very well, and the narrator/voice actors have done their roles justice - a crowd favourite would be Astarion, whose character is continuously surprising me with his unsolicited wit.

One of the biggest highlights of this game has been the endless choices and consequences you'll face; it really does come down to the type of life you want to live in BG3, thank god for scum saves huh? I am now on my 3rd play through, and each time I've started up a character, I find new things to explore that I didn't see the first time, and having conversations with all sorts of characters that I didn't know existed. The romancing is like the cherry on top for me - I'm actively pursuing that mf bear scene.

If you're buying this game, be ready to spend hours crafting your perfect character and learning how to run rampant in the realm of Faerun - don't let the combat style put you off, this game is way too good for you not to try.

But best game ever?
Right so I'm not going to sing it's praises, as everyone else has done this job.
I am going to list how it could have been better, and why it's maybe not the best game ever. Because I can:
1) Level Cap Limitations. Yes I've read the guff online of people defending the limit of 12, but they could easily have allowed you to level up to 15-16, without ruining the enjoyment of the game. Once you are in act 3 and you hit 12, you still have loads to do. Although I found most fights fun at 12, a few more levels, would have stopped me having to do a bit of cheese (and this was only on balanced mode, mind). If there are certain overpowered spells, remove or nerf them. They have basically done this already anyway. Dispel Magic anyone?
2) Inventory and Storage system. It's such a faff, yes I've seen worse, but I've also seen better. One chest for storage in your camp with limited sort options. No stacking of the same items, so many dagger slots!
3) The Aggro is too random. In the Goblin camp, you get into it with one group. Every Goblin in the world turns on you. In a prison you break someone out, kill all the guards and you are flirting with their colleagues at the top of the stairs, whilst the escaped prisoner is stood next to you. As the Goblin Camp is your first experience. It restricts experimentation, as you try and avoid combat in situations that are valid options, as you expect every man and their dog to turn on you.
4) It's too woke. Only joking. I thought it was fine, you snowflakes.",1706644636,1706644636,True,18,0,0.611754894256591797,0,True,False,False,True,

- Hobgoblins! (like Dror Ragzlin or even Blurg from the underdark)
- Goblin war bosses, warlocks, ones who can summon, giant spiders, wargs, 
- would love a feature which allows to summon a minotaur (once per short/long rest) either as a barbarian or ranger, or goblins
- having non-romancable companions like sassy dark humored dwarfs, gnomes, or any other stoic character from another race would've been amazing addition to the gameplay

Larian Studios definitely deserve the love they are receiving from the gaming community right now! The voice actors are just brilliant in their performances, characters are relatable in their personal motives, except romancing them seems a bit too forced sometimes tbh.

Working through the first act, having down most of it in EA, is already a bit of a slog.

The best game I have played in years. Of course all of this will be subjective, but the fact that I have put 170 hours into my first play-through and am already primed to go again, with no fatigue toward the game speaks volumes.

Pros:

1) An amazing, gripping story both mainline and side. You will be engrossed, you will be intrigued, you will laugh and you will feel sorrow.

2) Beautifully made characters who are unique, interesting and play off of each other. You will develop a connection and fondness toward them as you journey with them through the game.

3) Varied and robust turn-based gameplay. There is so much to do and so much experimentation that can be done with each of the classes. It's amazing.

4) Gorgeous graphics. When in conversation with characters, one can't help but look in awe at how wonderfully crafted they are, especially classes like Tieflings and Dragonborns.

Cons:

1) This may be a bit daunting for new players who do not know much about D&D combat. It's reasonably easy to pick up though, so don't give up if you feel a bit lost at the start.

2) That's it. That's all folks!

Because I needed to see alternate paths. Because I got new ideas.

Baldur's Gate 3 is not a perfect game, which is what everyone seems to focus on, but more importantly than perfect: it's damn good.

Sure, it has bugs. Any game of this complexity is always going to have bugs, but the developers have been on them from week one of release, not hiding and then releasing piddling patches months later like some lesser studios that are ostensibly ""AAA,"" and the bugs are mostly oddities and glitches, very few have been actual showstoppers.

Gameplay-wise it's probably the best D&D has ever been in a videogame, which is very much down to Larian twisting D&D until it creaks, mangling it as much as is possible without violating their contract to make it fun. I'm actually sad it's a D&D game, because everything I disliked about the game mechanically is from D&D, and Larian's previous game, Original Sin 2, lacked more of less all of these things. So I wish Larian had been given a freer hand to retain the aesthetics and conventions of D&D while tossing out the mechanics no one actually likes, like saving throws.

Story-wise, it's a very nice follow-up to the original Baldur's Gates, yeah, there are some connections but Larian are doing their own thing. It's also the first game in a long time well written enough that I felt bad about being evil. I got a genuine sense that I was betraying *people* and not just *data.* And considering how I've treated NPC's in many other games... that's a pretty high bar. It also has some of the most (intentionally) funny moments in a game ever, the comedy writing is superb. Light comedy, slice of life comedy, dark comedy, gallows humour... it helps the world come alive and make the characters feel like real characters.

Oh, and the game is absolutely woke. It's super-woke. If that scares you then go play a worse game because I don't want to see you crying on social media that dudes are allowed to kiss and you can choose your pronouns. Hell yeah Larian.

Also, the soundtrack absolutely rules. It sets the scene, it amplifies emotional punch, it makes intense battles even more fun.

My one... my ONE wish for the inevitable Larian Director's Cut, like we got for Original Sin is... dear God do we need more vocal boss battle themes. There's one in the game (no details because they'd be spoilers) and it was breathtaking. Turn the whole game into a musical. I wanna hear Auntie Ethel sing, I want to hear Karlach belt out a shanty, [i]make Astarion and Gale do a free-style rap[/i], go wild. 

I'd also like slightly higher difficulty. In DOS1 and DOS2, the Tactician modes put my balls through the wringer, in BG3, yeah, it was harder, but... it lacked that feeling of masochism. That feeling like I had to be borderline cheating to make my way through. Come on Larian. Hurt me harder. Make me cry. Make me swear. Make me spit blood after the game punches me in the face and calls me a loser dweeb. Make me throw my mouse against the wall hard enough to leave a dent, then come back two minutes later and furiously take another swing at the fight with a new idea. I want to suffer more.

But, ahem, yes, good game, worth your time, get the soundtrack.",1694011917,1694011917,True,7,0,0.608310997486114502,2,True,False,False,True,

It was a great crpg. I maybe had a few crashes and some graphics issues the first 3-4 weeks but nothing game breaking. I was even even able to make it to Act III and the Lower City.

Then they released a bunch of patches and hotfixes. My game broke. I had a 70% chance of any conversation started in the lower city crashing the game. That went up if it was in certain areas. The game would crash when fast traveling as well.

I started an alt. That went well for about the first few hours then I started having the same issues. Game crashes on talking/selling to vendors. Game crashing on important cutscenes. Game crashing when loading. I bought a game and expected it to work beginning to end. I bought a game expecting that fixes would fix things. Instead I now have a game taking 120+ gigs of space that I can't reliably play for over an hour.

I have removed and reinstalled the game. I have verified the game files multiple times. Every time it crashes I send a crash report. Something in one of the fixes broke the game for me and that is deeply frustrating.

For those who look to buy it wait a little longer and maybe they'll fix the issues they broke and make a working game again.

Edit: It has been a few weeks and they game still isn't working for me. Now it crashes at the Launcher. I moved the files to another drive and it still failed. I ran a verify again and still failed. Now I just removed it. If I have to delete my character profile and start all over this is going to piss me off. Also, I hit the level cap of 12 in Riverton and still had 20 hours of gameplay ahead.

I like these types of games, and I was quite hyped about something that scratched that itch. However, this aint it. I know I'm in the minority here, but I genuinely think there are parts of the design of this game that are just flawed.

The mechanic where abilities have a set number of uses before you have to rest, rather than having a cool down, is something brought over from the tabletop RPG. And it works in a tabletop context because the focus is on doing scenes, you usually don't put that much time into role playing walking from one scene to another. But in a computer game, where you play the uneventful parts as well, it just becomes another resource management chore. I get that they want you to have conversations with the companions in camp, but it feels very contrived and kind of breaks the flow of the game. 

Having dice rolls determine the outcome of situations is great when done right, like in [i]Disco Elysium[/i]. But for this to work, the result of failure has to be interesting in some way – it has to lead to character development, or progress the story in another direction than the one you expected. In a tabletop RPG, this is what a good GM does since save scumming isn't an option. But in BG3, failure mostly just leads to getting stuck or having to fight lots of enemies. Not once have I encountered a situation where a failure led to something interesting, funny, or story progressing. 

The companions suck for the most part. They're all rather one-note, and half of them are just grumpy assholes. I don't care about any of these characters, I have zero investment in them. Overall, the writing is pretty weak. The setup is rather rote and heavy handed, there's no sense of intrigue or mystery here. Why even have the big fight playing out in a cut scene, why not just have my character wake up in a broken pod with memory loss and then having to puzzle together what has happened (kind of like in [i]Planescape Torment[/i])? The quests mostly boil down to ""kill this guy"", at times using persuasion or stealth to kill them without having to fight quite as many minions. In act one, you have a situation where there are three leaders you have to get rid of. There is no way to play them out against each other, no way to poison them, no way to convince them their cause is doomed, no way to turn their underlings against them by framing them for something bad… In the end, you more or less have to fight and kill every minion in that location. And it's simply not interesting. 

As far as I can tell, my character has zero friends and zero attachments to the rest of the world – there are no old friends, they haven't been to any places before, they didn't have a job or a family or anything really before they ended up on that ship. Your only motivation is to get the parasite out of your brain, but because we haven't really seen anyone turn into a mind flayer it doesn't really feel like a pressing issue. The whole ilithid powers thing could have been interesting had they done something like what [i]Vampyr[/i] does, where giving in to the urges will make the game easier but also makes you lose more and more of your humanity. But there's none of that here, it's just a random super power that your character has because plot.",1715500573,1715500573,False,150,8,0.607354283332824707,0,True,False,False,True,

It's up there with Breath of the Wild in the mutability and reactivity to player input/player creativity, but it has a beautiful and compelling story with best-in-class voice acting and writing that games like BotW lack.

Divinity: Original Sin 1 & 2 were not my favorite games. As CRPGs went, I significantly preferred Pillars of Eternity, Tyranny, and others. But Baldur's Gate 3 is leaving me speechless and I'm only about halfway through. This game has *tremendous* replayability, not just because of branching conversations/decision paths, but because even the smallest spells/potions/physical positions can dramatically affect what you find, what you uncover, what you witness.  There are things my friends saw that I never saw in my playthrough, and so next time I roll a character and dive in I'll be able to see so much more I never knew was in the game.

The only critical stuff I've to say about this has to do with multiplayer. There aren't really alerts when party members initiate conversations without you, so all too often my co-op partner is advancing the story without me, or having really flavor-rich conversations without me knowing unless they explicitly say ""Hey I'm starting a conversation, come listen.""

But otherwise this game is a work of art, and it puts to shame all of the modern margin-chasing devs with their microtransactions.  We've all seen them cry desperate tears labeling Larian's development format as anomalous, but in no way is it impossible to copy. It's just impossible for people making the most aggressive margin plays their publisher overlords might allow.

I'm pretty sure most of these bugs will be fixed later on, and the story itself is solid so I can safely say you won't regret playing the game. But maybe wait for a major patch or a discount just to be safe",1694284051,1694284051,True,5,0,0.606598973274230957,0,True,False,False,True,

However, I regretted getting the game until around the 50 hour playtime mark, and still have a love/hate relationship with the game. This review focuses on why you may want to think twice about getting it.

Using the camera and moving around the environment always feels terrible. It is way too easy to misclick when trying to interact with people/items/bodies, and it is really annoying to accidentally start a conversation when I was trying to search an area, or worse attacking an ally when trying to attack an enemy. I misclicked on things hundreds of times in my playthroughs due to the awkward controls of the camera combined with point and click movement.

Holding a key down to show interactables in an area is annoying. This should have a toggle option.

Searching bodies is a tedious task after combat. It is made worse by having dead bodies show an * to signify they haven't been looted yet, and then being completely empty upon searching them.

Inventory management is a constant problem. You can place items into bags to keep similar items together, like scrolls bag, potions bag, etc. However, there is no way to automate this, so you have to drag every item you acquire manually into a bag or leave your inventory as a giant mess.

Combat where the enemy outnumbers your party, or combat that includes a bunch of allies with the party takes way too long for the ai to take its turn. You can be sitting around for 60 seconds or longer just waiting to get control back for your characters. There is not any option in game to fast forward through the ai turn.

Game can be buggy at times. One instance my party was permanently frightened after combat ended, leaving them unable to move, and I had to reload a save to fix it. Doors are very weird. Sometimes the game refuses to let my party through an open doorway, so I have to get a character to close the door and reopen it to pass through. This happened to me dozens of times. A few times the game let enemies attack through an open door, but when I tried to attack back the game stated the enemy couldn't be reached with either ranged attacks or melee. Companions also constantly got left behind, forcing me to separate them from the party, switch control to them, and then make my way back to the rest of the group. 

The game is designed with Dungeons and Dragons in mind, which is a good thing for players that enjoy that setting. However, in D&D, the dungeonmaster and the players create a story together, and having poor dice rolls at times is part of that story they create. With BG3, on the other hand, the story is already set (though quite complex), and if you roll poorly on key rolls, you end up missing out on parts of the story. This feels terrible as a player, and incentivizes save scumming (saving before an important roll and reloading every time it gets a bad result), which is not fun. It would be far more enjoyable if the story did not have randomness to it, and was solely based on the player's decisions, with some decisions availability being locked behind being a certain race or being proficient in a certain skill.

If the above issues do not bother you, or if you use mods to correct them, then it may be worth picking up Baldur's Gate 3. However, in the current state of the core game, I can not recommend it at this time.",1702697279,1702697279,False,135,9,0.606426835060119629,0,True,False,False,True,

[h1]Game Of the Decade In the Making[/h1]

You see games like these only few times in a decade, such level of detail, feel, complexity and replayability in BG3 are very rich in abundance. You don't have to worry about season passes, micro transactions or other sketchy monetization policies, you are getting a good bang for the buck truly. 

Now i still want to be objective here with this review and offer some pros&cons about it.

[h1]Pros[/h1]

There is stuff to do for everybody here. Want to be a barbarian and smash your way through the enemy lines while raging? Sure, be my guest. Want to seduce everyone and everything and inspire your companions to battle while flirting with the neighborhood tiefling? Bard's the choice for you!

The devs continue to fix the small bugs (and the big ones) that may have been plaguing your gameplay, which shows they truly care about their game. Just get it already!

The music is just phenomenal, the set scenes are amazing and everything you can interact with and change within the game world just makes it so much more enticing to play.

Alas, the timeline was severed, and a decade passed saw us go from ""here's a couple of gay people even if it's thematically and tonally inappropriate"" to ""everyone copulates with everything"" as well as a total abolition of such barbaric concepts as ""preferences"" and ""sexual orientation"".

It's a shame we've relapsed back into dnd both mechanically and even aesthetically (see: all the tabletop fetishism) but I also wouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth, since -- apart from a couple of irritating quirks -- it might just be the crown jewel of the modern cRPG revival wave on top of being one of the best cRPGs ever made.

The first thing you'll notice is a total lack of filler as just about every single encounter is a meaningful puzzle with countless ways to get through. Stealth it, persuade it, intimidate it, convince it to eat itself, disguise yourself with magic and pretend to be of the same race, chop it to bits with an axe, get a hold of crucial information by talking to a corpse and/or an animal, turn INTO a small animal and slip into a tiny crevice between the rocks, disguise yourself as a halfling and THEN shrink yourself to slip into a tiny crevice between the rocks -- I almost recommend playing a non-charisma character just so you don't get tempted to blindly slam the persuasion option instead of all the other ones.

Everything from environments and characters to inventory icons is painstakingly crafted with an obsessive, lavish flair as you go from watching well-directed, cinematic cutscenes to building a tower of boxes to throw your enlarged owlbear off of on top of a bunch of enemies. Larian manages to marry the unmarriable, combining deep RPG elements, interactive sandbox-tinkering and a cinematic, story-based experience.

Having played a bit of Divinity Original Sin 2, the quality of the narrative was of the biggest concern, yet -- ironically -- the quirk chungus writing one would normally expect in a dnd-esque setting, that was so prevalent in and poisonous to DOS2, is significantly less present in a game that's based on ACTUAL dnd.

It's not by any means flawless: the writing is not perfect as some of the characters are eye-rolling and, in line with the current game design trends, the overbearing UI will blatantly spoil you secret passages with its Bethesda-style quest-markers while at the same time offering very little QoL to deal with the game's truly mind-boggling amount of loot -- both meaningful and other not so much.

Despite the irritations, BG3 is a genuinely massive step up for Larian as a studio and cRPGs as a genre.
Not a performative tired mediocre retread every Obsidian game seems to be nowadays.
Not a bloated autistic mess you get by getting an Owlcat game.
Instead, a love letter to cRPGs as well as those times when blind passion birthed a genre that is somehow finding a second wind all these years later.",1692216653,1692216806,True,6,0,0.603707790374755859,0,True,False,False,True,

Summary: What to say, what to do... except to bow humbly to so much talent. Larian Studios once again proves its know-how in the field of role-playing games and even manages to enhance the rich and complex universe of Dungeons & Dragons. Baldurs' Gate 3 is quite simply the best video game adaptation of D&D ever made. This adventure “of which you are the hero” shines with its generosity, its mastery of the codes of the genre and this constant desire to surpass oneself. BG3 can boast of being to this day the ultimate video game experience for roleplayers, but not only that. Of course, this RPG requires a good PC to play in optimal conditions and is a little difficult to learn, especially for the uninitiated. But playing Baldur’s Gate means creating your own story, a story that is uniquely yours. For just that (and more), the pleasure is total !

1 tablespoon (14g) butter
1 tablespoon (9g) extra virgin olive oil
6 cloves garlic, rough chopped
2 teaspoons (4g) red pepper flakes
28 oz (794g) can of crushed tomato
2 teaspoons (2g) dried oregano

2 cups (227g) low moisture mozzarella, fresh grated
2 cups (200g) Monterey jack cheese, fresh grated
1/2 cup (26g) parmigiano reggiano, fresh grated
American Pizza Dough:
Preheat the oven and a baking steel or pizza stone at 500F for 45 minutes before utilizing it.
Whisk yeast and sugar into your water, and allow it to sit for 5 minutes. In a separate bowl, add flour and salt and mix by hand to combine. Pour your water mixture into your flour and mix by hand until you get a rough dough, then transfer to a work surface and knead until it starts to pull away from the work surface and is relatively smooth.
Place your dough in a greased bowl, then cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 1 - 2 hours at room temperature or until double in size.
Punch down your dough and dive into 300g pieces. Form those pieces into balls and place them in a floured proofing pizza box, cover with a lid, and proof at room temperature for 3 - 4 hours. (If you do not have a proofing pizza box, you can use a floured baking sheet, cover it with an inverted baking sheet and wrap it in plastic wrap.)
American Pizza Sauce and Toppings:
In a medium sauce pot, add butter and olive oil. Set that over medium-high heat; once the butter melts add garlic, cook until fragrant, add pepper flakes, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic begins to brown on the edges.
Add crushed tomatoes, oregano, salt, and a splotch of olive oil, boil over medium-high, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 12 minutes, stirring occasionally or until thickened and viscous—season with salt to taste and let it cool down.
Assembly.- Place one of your pizza doughs onto a floured pizza peel, and flour your dough generously.
Punch your dough down in the center, working your way out to create a ¼” wide. Pick up your dough, place it over your closed fists, and rotate it around, gently stretching to 13” to 14”.
Place a couple of spoons of your sauce, starting in the center, spreading in little circles, and working your way to the edge until it gets evenly spread out.

The story is interesting enough for me to catch my attention while I find myself constantly being sidetracked with side quests and exploration. The world is vast and there's many to do and find while taking the unbeaten path. Although I'm only 63 hours in at the time of writing this, I'm still in Act 1 exploring the areas. There are times where I've facepalmed and my clicking has lead to deaths of some party members - I click somewhere and they end up running into lava then doing an action when I wanted them to do the action from their pre-lava area.

Gameplay wise, it's excellent. It feels a lot more fast paced compared to the little amount of DOS2 that I played. It's fun trying to organize your crew while also figuring out enemies' strengths and weaknesses. The point and click can be somewhat clunky as I've found myself attacking the air next to enemies sometimes, but overall the battle system is fun and enjoyable having to manage resources.

Multiplayer is great. I've only played 2 hours with my partner, but from what I've gathered, the multiplayer is smooth without any hiccups from what I've noticed.

This ties into the exploration, but the setting and scenery is fantastic. Everything looks beautiful with varying graphic settings (1080 ti & i7-8700k). The areas are vast and feel lived in.

This is my review after 63 hours and little progress in the game, but I'm confident that these sentiments will stay the same throughout my playthrough. I'd highly recommend this game whether you're into this type of thing or not, it's a great time sink while also being fun and immersive.",1692786148,1692786148,True,7,0,0.601449251174926758,0,True,False,False,True,

It was a great adventure! I am positively surprised that I could do a quicksave during the last fight, since I had to repeat it several times.

First I would like to mention the good things. Graphics is great, the story is well thought out, you have many options to choose from, eventhough sometimes the options are a bit too different from each other, but some people may see it as a good thing.
The environment design is beautiful, the battles are getting more epic as you progress through the game and the game is not easy on the easiest difficulty, which I chose, because I felt overwhelmed at first, since this is my first Baldur's Gate game to play. And of course I can't forget character creation, which is awesome.
I didn't romance a lot of characters, because I skipped a lot of the dialogues, but the romantic scenes are satisfying. And I could probably say a lot more positive things, which are mentioned in other reviews.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3089264101
There are also some negatives, which are hard to ignore, especially in Act 3.
Sometimes when I go with my party through a street that has people in it, 3 of my characters sometimes just stop and I am only able to control my leading character. And it takes quite a lot of time for them to get unstuck, sometimes I have to load a save, when I am out of patience. I would expect a game with so many positive reviews and good ratings to not have this problem.
Sometimes when I jump somewhere with my leading character, the other characters dont jump with me or they jump when I jump back and then they jump back and so on. This fortunately does not happen as often as 3 party members getting stuck in a crowded street. Sometimes the street isn't even crowded and they stop anyway.
What really disappointed me is quest management. Yes, the quests page is simple, but there is no option to track a quest and all the quest markers are displayed on the map and it can be confusing to know where to go.
Some people complain about inventory management, but so far I had no problems using it.

Overall, the game is very good, there are so many things that are done right, that it is not hard to overlook the problems. I might add some stuff later after more playthroughs, since I would like to get all the achievements in the game.

I didn't look at or played act 1 in early access, so had no expectations beyond the game probably being like Original Sin 2, except in a DnD coat, and hopefully with better writing since that has been a bit of a Larian weak point. Yet every hour of (co-op) Baldurs Gate 3 we played, we realised more and more this is something much bigger than the Original Sin games are, even if they are great games in their own right.

Larian has taken the best of old Bioware here, crafting great stories and characters with interesting backgrounds and plot developments during the game. This is wrapped up in a gorgeous coat and presented in a cinematic way, like Bioware did in their Dragon Age games. The game feels like the closest successor to Dragon Age: Origins in these regards, one of my favourite games, especially considering it doesn't waste any of your time with mindless bloat quests or open world emptiness. Every house and street you can access is there for some purpose, to draw you into a quest or story, or to be the background for cool battles, cutscenes, or shops. The incredible variety of characters both with you and against you are wonderfully realised and superbly voice acted, and everybody will be able to pick out their own cast of favourites. 

The gameplay is as close to DnD as a game has been able to come. The spells are vividly transported to video game form, and you have seemingly a hundred ways to deal with any given encounter, be it talking your way out of it, or getting into the fantastic combat system that will keep the game very replayable. There are so many builds to try, so many stories to see different outcomes of, and so many ways to replay encounters in completely different ways.

Now, this game has been hailed as the digital embodiment of tabletop RPG goodness. And to a degree, it lives up to that billing. Imagine a world rooted in Dungeons & Dragons' Fifth Edition rules, complete with dice rolls, big decisions, and character customization that can fill a library. It’s a playground for roleplaying aficionados, no doubt. But let’s clear the air here; it's not a perfect replication of that magic you get from friends huddled around a table. It's close, though, impressively close.

In my first go, I embraced the life of a charismatic Warlock who used words more than weapons. I dished out charisma points like a smooth-talking sage, often sidestepping battles with honeyed words instead of swords. It’s like I was creating my own hero’s story, etching it with dialogue, spells, and even my choice of armor. As I delved deeper, I began pushing the game’s boundaries, testing how far it could bend to my whims. And you know what? Sometimes, Baldur’s Gate 3 surprised me. It got in step with my audacity, reacting to choices I never thought it would.

Now, hold up. The game does have its quirks. You see, the journal can sometimes play coy, leaving me head-banging against puzzles that were more cryptic crossword than coherent quest. But, oh boy, when things clicked, it was like solving a riddle while riding a roller coaster. As the plot unfolded, I found myself deeply tangled with a motley crew of characters cursed by parasitic tadpoles, a real smorgasbord of dysfunction. Shadowheart, the faithful yet prejudiced Cleric; Gale, the ambitious Wizard grappling with hubris; Astarion, a vampire Rogue whose moral compass is a bit wonky. Trust me, this bunch should come with a warning label: ""Handle with Care.""

The heart of Baldur’s Gate 3 lies in these misfit relationships. It’s not all hugs and harmony; it’s a rollercoaster of friction and begrudging respect. Take Wyll, my trusty tank, for instance. He had my back in battle but wasn’t always on board with my decisions. The dice rolls and stats checks often weighed on our rapport, dictating how our stories intertwined. Sure, the characters were complex, but the dynamics often felt precariously perched. Survival glued us together, not shared ideals. And it showed. You could see this in every campfire conversation, every hesitant alliance, every unspoken agenda.

Larian Studios deserves a round of applause for the character writing. Be it a casual chat by the campfire or a grand romantic gesture (yes, you can have love stories here), their voices rang true, carrying the weight of their individual tales. You could even choose to play as these pre-made characters, but trust me, building your own legend is where the magic lies. Trust me, playing your fave might be fun, but it’s like covering a classic song. Your voice, your journey, it's what counts.

But, guess what, Baldur’s Gate 3 is no one-trick pony. It’s like a jack-of-all-trades, effortlessly blending tactical RPG with immersive sim. In battles, it’s not just about throwing fireballs at foes. It’s about thinking smart, about combining your party’s skills like pieces of a puzzle. Gale’s Cloud of Daggers becomes a whirling death vortex when my Eldritch Blast shoves enemies into its embrace. And there’s more. By the gods, there’s more! The game serves up new abilities at every level, encouraging creative experimentation, making me ponder all the avenues of mayhem at my fingertips.

And that dungeon puzzle! Let me tell you about that. At first, I attacked it head-on, but Baldur’s Gate 3 isn’t about brute force. No, it’s an intricate dance, where abilities are your partners. My character’s Gaseous Form spell didn’t just transform them into smoke; it let me soar over traps and sensors, bypassing obstacles in a clever twist of logic. And that, my friends, is where Baldur’s Gate 3 wins big. It’s more than an RPG; it’s a canvas for your creativity. It’s a symphony of strategy, a haven for unconventional thinking.

Yes, I’ll admit it. Baldur’s Gate 3 may not capture the unfettered imagination of a tabletop session. But guess what? It gets close, damned close. Larian Studios managed to replicate that thrill, that sensation of an open world shaped by your choices. Now, don’t you dare expect all RPGs to match this magic; it’s a rare concoction. See, the game isn’t just a mere product; it’s a labor of love that simmered for years during its development. You’ll be hard-pressed to find another RPG that simmers this long. So, here’s the deal: Baldur’s Gate 3 isn’t perfect, but it’s as close to RPG alchemy as you can get. A journey well worth embarking on.",1691785595,1691785595,True,5,0,0.60000002384185791,0,True,False,False,True,
